    "title": "ReplaceAll + InSelection needs better post-replace selected-text behavior",
    "body": "### Description of the Issue\n\nAccording to this recent discussion in the Community forum...\n\nhttps://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/20470\n\n...the _Replace All_ feature with _In Selection_ qualifier could work better in regards to what happens to the active selection after the replacement is finished.\n\nCurrently, what happens to the active selection is whatever Scintilla thinks should happen, because Notepad++ code for this operation does not do anything to change the selection (I know, because I single-stepped it to see).\n\nSo...we can do better; let's propose some new rules.  After a _Replace All_ + _In Selection_ operation:\n\n* post-replace selection start = pre-replace selection start\n\n* if replacement operation lengthens the document, post-replace selection end = pre-replace selection end + length of increase\n\n* if replacement operation shortens the document, post-replace selection end = pre-replace selection end - length of decrease\n\n* if replacement operation shortens the document such that all text in the pre-replace selection is eliminated, there will be no active selection post-replace\n\nThese proposed changes facilitate one situation in particular:  When this operation is recorded into a macro that does several of these in a row.  Currently, because the selection is not-particularly deterministic, this type of multiple-operation macro is not realistic.\n\nThe referenced Community topic above does a good job at describing an example, but let's repeat it here, with some small changes:\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. Start with text `foobar`.  Select this text.\n2. Do a _Replace All_ operation with the _In Selection_ checkbox ticked, with a _Find what_ of `foo` and a _Replace with_ of `FOO`.\n3. Notice post-replace that the selected text is `FOObar` (good):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/102239591-064b2700-3ec5-11eb-8c08-319051d23423.png)\n4. Without user-change of the current text selection, do a _Replace All_ operation with the _In Selection_ checkbox ticked, with a _Find what_ of `bar` and a _Replace with_ of `BAR`.\n5. Notice post-replace that the selected text is `FOO` (not so good, probably `FOOBAR` should be the selected text):\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/102239659-17943380-3ec5-11eb-91f0-3566e33f4289.png)\n6. Without user-change of the current text selection, do a _Replace All_ operation with the _In Selection_ checkbox ticked, with a _Find what_ of `.+` and a _Replace with_ of `${0}!!`.  Do this with _Regular expression_ set as the _Search mode_.\n7. Notice post-replace that the resulting text is `FOO!!BAR` and that nothing is selected.  This is \"not so good\" when one compares with the \"Expected result\" final text/selection:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/102239348-c3894f00-3ec4-11eb-8aa7-26770f00e4c2.png)\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n1.

This goes against the menu item's \"Mark **ALL**\" concept but in certain circumstances it can be valuable to do this.  One circumstance is when copying styled text to the clipboard and wanting to avoid redundant data.\n\nSome other user requests for this:\n\n* https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/20466\n* https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/post/59207\n\nI alluded to the user needing this feature when I added the \"Copy Styled Text\" capability to Notepad++ via this issue and its PR:  #8943 , specifically in these comments:\n\n- https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/8943#issuecomment-702878124\n- https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/8943#issuecomment-702862998\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Issue\n<!--- Set of steps to reproduce this issue -->\n1.

Place the caret inside the word `Jack` in the first line\n3. Invoke _Search_ menu > _Mark All_ > _Using 1st style_\n4. Observe all occurrences of `Jack` are styled in the cyan color:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/102022794-29f05f00-3d57-11eb-933e-9c573ba7f4f7.png)\n\n### Expected Behavior\nI expected a way to have only the currently selected text, or the current word at the caret, to be styled with one of the five styling colors, not all prior and future instances of the text.\n\n### Actual Behavior\nAll occurrences of identical text were styled with the color I chose.

Example (with visible whitespace turned on, via Pythonscript plugin):\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/84452150-fe16e400-ac22-11ea-841e-be4d8f61a2b6.png)\n\nI propose hard-setting this tab character in the output to have a width of 4.

    "body": "Recently some users have complained that the location of the bookmark manipulation commands is too far removed from one of the primary methods for auto-setting of bookmarks, the _Mark_ tab in the _Find_ window.\n\nLocated in the _Search_ menu under the _Bookmark_ submenu, multiple users have said that it would make more sense to have bookmark handling commands right on the _Mark_ tab because it takes too much \"menuing around\" to access these commands.\n\nAnd while all of the bookmark commands are able to be mapped to shortcut keycombos to avoid the \"menuing around\", no one really wants to try to remember many new keycombos.\n\nI personally don't think these commands belong on the _Mark_ tab of the _Find_ window.  I think a much better thing to do is to have a context menu with the bookmark commands show itself when the user right-clicks the bookmark margin.\n\nThe entire Bookmark submenu, if popped up on right-click, would very useful and intuitive.  (Okay, so maybe _Toggle Bookmark_ isn't really worth it, since that's the behavior of a left-click on the bookmark margin.)  _Next_ and _Previous_ are very handy, as are _Copy_, _Cut_ and _Inverse_.\n\nOriginal user complaints may be found at this [LINK](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/19404).\n\nFeature request based off of behavior current to N++ 7.8.6\n\nReference image of existing _Search_ > _Bookmark_ menu:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/82962850-5e552700-9f8f-11ea-92fb-087e15a61d1a.png)\n",

    "title": "\"Purge for each search\" option for \"Mark All\" action should respect \"In selection\" option",
    "body": "### Description of the Issue\n\nAs hinted at in a comment to #6271...\n\nThe `Purge for each search` option, when selected, will cause all marks in a document to be removed when a new `Mark All` operation is performed.  Normally this is the desired behavior.  However, if the `In Selection` option is also chosen, the marking operation should respect that and only purge the marks in the selection before marking the newly-specified text (also limited to the current selection).\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Issue\n\n1. Copy the following text into a new Notepad++ tab:\n\n```\nJack and Jill\nWent up the hill\nTo fetch a pail of water\nJack fell down\nAnd broke his crown,\nAnd Jill came tumbling after.\n\nUp Jack got\nAnd home did trot,\nAs fast as he could caper;\nAnd went to bed\nAnd plastered his head\nWith vinegar and brown paper.\n\nWhen Jill came in\nHow she did grin\nTo see Jack's paper plaster;\nMother vexed\nDid whip her next\nFor causing Jack's disaster.\n\n```\n2. Invoke the Mark dialog.\n3. Untick all checkboxes; tick Wrap around checkbox.\n4. Put `Jack` in Find what box.\n5. Press Mark All button.  Note the marking that occurs throughout the document.\n6. Select the entire first \"paragraph\" aka the first 6 lines.\n7. Tick the `In selection` checkbox in the Mark dialog.\n8. Tick the `Purge for each search` checkbox in the Mark dialog.\n9. Put `Jill` in Find what box.\n10. Press the `Mark All` button.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nBecause `In selection` and `Purge for each search` are ticked, I expect the `Mark All` button to only clear marking in the selected text before running the new mark operation.\n\nThis should be what it looks like after Step 10:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/69551344-8923db80-0f6a-11ea-8358-3503b0c04cae.png)\n\n### Actual Behavior\nAll marking in the document is cleared before running the new marking operation.\n\nThis is what it currently looks like after Step 10:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/69551167-419d4f80-0f6a-11ea-98fb-e5fa23448028.png)\n\n### Debug Information\nNotepad++ v7.8   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Oct  7 2019 - 00:58:16\nPath : C:\\............\\npp.7.8.bin\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : ON\nOS Name : Windows 10 Enterprise (64-bit) \nOS Version : 1709\nOS Build : 16299.1451\nPlugins : ColumnTools.dll Explorer.dll LocationNavigate.dll MarkdownViewerPlusPlus.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExec.dll NppExport.dll PythonScript.dll \n\n### Other Notes:\n\n(Red)marking shown in the above.

    "title": "Count / ReplaceAll / MarkAll option \"In Selection\" should not be available with multiple selections",
    "body": "### Description of the Issue\n\nThe Count / ReplaceAll / MarkAll functions of the Find window allow a user to specify \"In Selection\" with multiple selections active.  Logically, this makes sense, but those functions only deal with a single \"main\" selection.  Until such a time when those functions are expanded to allow true multiple selection counting/replacing/marking, \"In Selection\" should not be allowed as a choice when multiple selections are active, because Count / ReplaceAll / MarkAll will affect a different amount of text than the user expects.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce the Issue\n<!--- Set of steps to reproduce this issue -->\n1. Make sure that `Multi-Editing Settings` are enabled in the Preferences' `Editing` area:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/68522510-03b9df00-027a-11ea-9a5b-d142733ab65a.png)\n\n2. In a new Notepad++ tab, paste the following text:\n```\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n```\n3. Use the mouse to select the first three lines. This is now the \"main\" selection, as it is the only selection:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/68522548-4d0a2e80-027a-11ea-8e7e-40c28f81d0b1.png)\n4. Hold Ctrl and select (with the mouse) the last three lines into a second selection.  This is now the \"main\" selection as it is the most recently made selection:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/68522559-775bec00-027a-11ea-9f6f-5194f7452812.png)\n5. Invoke the Mark dialog from the Search menu and set it up as follows:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/68522572-ad00d500-027a-11ea-82cb-ae537240351e.png)\n6. Press the `Mark All` button and observe the results.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI expected every `a` in *both* active selections to be marked.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30118311/68522590-d7eb2900-027a-11ea-9f39-8166f5854568.png)\nOnly the `a`s on the last three lines (the current \"main\" selection) have been marked.  This is confusing to the user as there are clearly `a`'s in a selection that didn''t get marked.  This confusion could be avoided by disallowing `In selection` as a choice when multiple selections are active, much like it is disallowed when a rectangular selection is active.\n\n### Debug Information\n\nNotepad++ v7.8   (32-bit)\nBuild time : Oct  7 2019 - 00:58:16\nPath : C:\\........\\npp.7.8.bin\\notepad++.exe\nAdmin mode : OFF\nLocal Conf mode : ON\nOS Name : Windows 10 Enterprise (64-bit)\nOS Version : 1709\nOS Build : 16299.1451\nPlugins : ColumnTools.dll Explorer.dll LocationNavigate.dll MarkdownViewerPlusPlus.dll mimeTools.dll NppConverter.dll NppExec.dll NppExport.dll PythonScript.dll\n\n### Notes\n\nMarkAll was used as an example, but Count and ReplaceAll work similarly with multiple selections.\n",

This is nice, but it does not accurately reflect the actual indentation.\n\nThis issue is of particular interest when using python, but it is probably valid for other language with syntactical whitespace like YAML perhaps.\n\nConsider the following python snippet, for example,\n```\nif example:\n\tif nest:\n\t\tdo_stuff()\n#\n# The indents are removed here and there are two newlines\nif example2:\n\tif nest:\n\t\tdo_stuff()\n#\n# same here, two newlines then EOF, no actual indent\n```\nThe result looks like:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35270292/59945067-0d0df080-942c-11e9-9675-f208bba10e34.png)\n\nAs you can see in the image, even though there isn't actually any indentation, the vertical indicator remains until the next line of code or EOF.\n\nAs much as I hate using VSCode, I believe they did it right:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35270292/59944732-28c4c700-942b-11e9-8656-c8c0eae0d2f5.png)\n\nI personally have admittedly odd spacing habits, but the way indentation indicators inexorably trail blocks of code makes reading larger files a bit more difficult, and gets ~~exponentially, in my opinion,~~ more difficult with each level of indentation a block of code contains.",
