This entails the ability to seamlessly drag and drop content to desired locations. Additionally, it would be highly beneficial to extend this capability to include the dragging of items within a 'toggle' element, smth I use frequently in Notion, particularly with code blocks. Here is an example of how Notion does it:\n\n![image](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/assets/18092968/50b829d8-46d6-4132-9742-1a055158ad25)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nThis feature significantly enhances the application's usability by introducing a more intuitive and flexible content organization system. The ability to drag and drop content, streamlines user interactions and makes the application more adaptable to individual preferences.

As I recall this was already suggested in another issue.\n\nEDIT: I think the type of grid and image order should depend on their size.\nEDIT 2: Creating an album of existing images could mean having a button in image block options to select images to group. I don't know how this aligns with how things are done in apps. \nEDIT 3: Suggestion on how this could be implemented is creating a separate \"image album block\" in the `/` menu.",

    "body": "## Feature Information\n\nSince I have been using `AppFlowy` this is an issue I have been facing, i.e the text is too small and there's no option to scale it either. While, there is an option to scale the in document text there's no option to scale the complete app text altogether.\n\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-17 17-55-35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37607224/232483453-7cfd1693-f154-481b-a2a5-de0231c57adc.png)\n> Here, I have scaled the document text to my comfort but the side bar text remains unaffected.\n\n- It's a normal feature to keep different font sizes for the document and the other app texts, and that should be the same here as well. Thus, we should also keep a feature where the user can scale the text of the app layout (discluding document/editing area).\n\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n- In AppFlowy we have created `text.dart` to centralize the use of text widgets in the application. However, it contains only three styles `{regular, semibold, medium}` which does not suffices the use cases through out the app.\n- While we are not using the `text.dart` throughout the project, the places where we use it we completely override the properties, like:\n```dart\nFlowyText.medium(\n   LocaleKeys.deletePagePrompt_restore.tr(),\n   color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onPrimary,\n   fontSize: 14, // Hard coded value, can not change it via settings\n),\n```\n- In the other places we are simply using the `Text` widget directly and provide the `fontSize: double` as hard coded value.\n\n## Solution\n\n- In `appearance.dart` we define the font sizes and also save it to device. The settings set in `appearance.dart` should be used globally throughout the application, to set the font size. Like:\n```dart\nFlowyText(\n \"Some Text\",\n fontSize: Theme.of(context).textTheme.displayMedium,\n)\n```\n> Now when we change the preferences from `appearance.dart` it should be visible globally. Note that this does not alter with the `document` level preferences as it is stored separately via `DocumentAppearanceCubit`.\n\n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers which like to scale the App Features excluding the Editing Area, will now be able to change it and view it according to their comfort.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

Link icon on the tool bar disabled until you select some text, even if your cursor is on a existing link.\n5. **UPDATE** 🐛 On a link if you add text, the link is cut in two.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Link cut in two</summary>\n\n![Screen Recording 2022-06-28 at 12 09 34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22211097/176228463-a494774f-9fbc-49a1-b918-d0a5264da503.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. A link should be clickable (or a tooltip should indicate how to open it, like for example: Ctrl + click)\n2. On the dialog to set a link we could have a 'delete'/'clear' button, when we clear the URL text field and click on 'save' the link should be deleted.\n3. If the URL is invalid the 'save' button should be disabled and an error message under the text field should explain the error\n4. If the cursor is positioned in a link, the link button is enabled.\n5. The added text should be added to the link.\n6. On a long hover, the user could see a helper that should allow to open or edit the link\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: MacOS\n - Version: 0.0.4.1\n",
