    "title": "Reroutes cannot be used as compact visual switch in 1.15",
    "body": "Hello, \n\nI know it's not a widespread usage, but I really liked to use the old `Reroute` nodes as a visual UI switch : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3697471-dadd-45fa-bf9d-e2f1b3289790)\n\nThis allows me to refer to a distant portion of the workflow and visually choose the route to use. This representation feels more natural to me than a regular integer switch.\n\nSadly, with the new implementation of the reroute nodes in 1.15 and later, the \"orphan\" reroute nodes are discarded, and cannot be used in this manner anymore :  \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0d3b1f1-f648-4d53-88a5-181deceabcb0)\n\nEven if I force the creation of an orphan `Reroute` node, it is greyed and cannot be connected to another reroute easily : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/890063c7-405e-442a-825d-2bafb400a511)\n\nI would like a way to use the orphan nodes as a visual switch like before, to maintain compatibility with my older workflows.\n\nBarring this choice, I guess I'll use Get/Set nodes as a workaround, but it would be great if we could select the output of a collapsed node as long as there is only one. For example here : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56506732-63df-4ac5-8e8c-b7783b299930)\n\nEven if the scheduler all have a single output, I must expand those to be able to connect it to the reroute node. I could use a `Switch (Any)` node instead, but it has a really bigger footprint.\n\nAnyone knows a good compact switch node ? Even using a collapsed switch node with a single integer constant node expanded aside to make the selection takes way more space than the visual switch trick.\n\nAnyway, thanks for hearing my rant. 😅\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Issue-3247-Reroutes-cannot-be-used-as-compact-visual-switch-in-1-15-1c36d73d365081ea9db1e85dfdbc2866) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

    "title": "Improve performance when large number of prompts are queued",
    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits\n\n### What would your feature do ?\n\nThere are some users who queue a large number of prompts at a time with large graphs. It is commonly reported from them that overall performance suffers a lot when doing this. The issue is the frequency and eagerness of requests/messages to the queue endpoint.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open DevTools in the browser (F12)\n2. Go to the Network tab\n3. In the search/filter bar type 'queue'\n4. Go back to the graph without closing DevTools\n5. Create a workflow with a lot of nodes\n6. Increase the batch count on the `Run` button to a high number\n7. Press `Run`\n8. Observe the `/queue` responses in the Network panel:\n    ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d27ee149-29ba-47f5-b943-451d5b74e411)\n10. Notice that:\n    - The `/queue` response includes the entire workflow for every single pending task (along with other fields). The type is here:\n    https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/blob/8db088b27a5669e423b1d2644fa574bf4a3c3d85/src/schemas/apiSchema.ts#L185-L193\n    - Requests to `/queue` are eager\n    - The `queueStore` updates the queue and history in the same `update` action. As a result, `/queue` requests are made when tasks are created and when tasks are completed, which is probabaly not necessary. \n    - Requests to `/queue` are made for each task created, even those created in batches\n\n### Possible solutions\n\n1. Send prompts to server less eagerly when batch size of queue button is large\n3. Only request necessary properties of queued prompts\n4. Don't repeatedly request information about queued items since they are not subject to change\n5. Add `max_items` param to queue endpoint, similar to history \n6. Evaluate graph less eagerly or use DP, although the issue seems to be with the large frequent requests rather than graph evaluation\n \n### Proposed workflow\n\n1. Load large graph\n2. Increase batch count to 200+ e.g., to run over-night or while out of house\n3. Press queue button\n4. The app works at same efficiency/speed as it does during normal usage\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe `/history` endpoint, used for completed tasks, faced the same issue in the past. It was solved by limiting the number of items returned in the request (https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/393).\n\nThe `maxItems` arg is supported in the `/history` route handler on the backend, but not for the `/queue` handler.\n\nFor reference, implementation of `max_items` for `/history`:\n\n- [Backend](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/94f21f93012173d8f1027bc5f59361cf200b8b37/server.py#L603-L608)\n- [Frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/blob/f7b613c6cb34955176c586e7b27f8f7a00841b96/src/stores/queueStore.ts#L335-L363)\n\n### Related issues\n\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/2000#issuecomment-2631586686\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/discussions/7284\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/6939\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/6676\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/5073\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/2000\n- https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/8070\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Issue-2435-Improve-performance-when-large-number-of-prompts-are-queued-1916d73d3650817182f1d64620824b60) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

The browser message cannot be customized due to security reasons enforced by browser vendors.\n> \n> The default setting value is false. Later after the workflow manager redesign, we should have the dialog popup based whether there is unsaved content.

Here I have a suggested solution for the team to consider and apply to the interface.\n1. This is the default interface, looking at the bunch of links is very confusing, to hide the link you have to go into the settings and go through many steps.\n![demo0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39de1cf0-57a8-44ec-9088-6253af96b141)\n2. here is my idea, add a button to make it more intuitive\n ![demo1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224fb249-f1f0-454e-b89b-de534ac77642)\n3. and this is when you click hide link\n![demo2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94269d2a-43fd-4990-9b02-f2e2ad890a9f)\n4.add link display style\n![demo3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c61fd1-79d4-402e-a87a-2385c20d603f)\nHave a goodday ^^\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\n1.

Here’s a visual example of what I’m referring to:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e892d95-6879-4d19-a9e9-080c537fac46)\nIn ComfyUI, users must manually convert their desired input, which can be time-consuming and less intuitive compared to Blender’s approach.\nHere are some advantages of Blender's node interface:\n- Dual Input Mode: Nodes should display both a text input box and a connection port. This allows for quick adjustments and direct connections.\n- Automatic Textbox Disable: When a node’s input is connected to another node’s output, the text input box should be automatically disabled. This prevents conflicting inputs and streamlines the workflow.\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\ni don't know how it works, but you may can check blender's source code, it is open source.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

For example, when creating a new node in the right-click menu, the font is set very small to display more. However, for the current new list, although it is more convenient to find nodes, the font and spacing have become larger. If there are many search results, it will take a long time to scroll the mouse. Adding this setting can facilitate everyone to adjust it according to their own preferences. ",
