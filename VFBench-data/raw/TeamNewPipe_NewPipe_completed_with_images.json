I found by accident that you must press the down button to get to it. So the current position is counter intuitive. \n\n### Why do you want this feature?\n\nIMHO the full screen button, should be placed up and on the right, for example.\n![image](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/10577035/d6a2839b-b786-4c4e-826a-7667958df9c8)\n\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I made sure that there are *no existing issues* - [open](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues) or [closed](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) - which I could contribute my information to.\n- [X] I have read the [FAQ](https://newpipe.net/FAQ/) and my problem isn't listed.\n- [X] I'm aware that this is a request for NewPipe itself and that requests for adding a new service need to be made at [NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/issues).\n- [X] I have taken the time to fill in all the required details.

This feature worked well without a problem on my Samsung A12 but doesn't appear to work on my new Samsung A13. \n\nThere is an app called Music Player Go that I downloaded from F-Droid that allows me to do this. I can close the app while music is playing and the music does not stop. When I access the pull down menu by swiping from the top of the phone I have a simple preview bar with pause play for Music Player Go. I used to be able to do the same with Newpipe on my Samsung A12. I can no longer do this with the A13 for Newpipe. \n\nI have attached screenshots to help better visualize what I mean. I used Music Player Go because it functions exactly the way that I am requesting Newpipe work again. \n\n\n\n\n\n### Why do you want this feature?\n\nThere would be less UI clutter. There would be less apps to swipe through when I hit the android app overview \"button\" (the three bars on the bottom left of my Samsung A13). This allows me to scroll through only the high priority apps I want access to. \n\n\n\n### Additional information\n\n<img alt=\"photo_1_2024-05-22_11-17-19\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/170545146/4c39a0c0-44aa-4ec7-9d97-3395832dd35a\" width=270 />\n<img alt=\"photo_2_2024-05-22_11-17-19\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/170545146/5f906a60-bec0-45f1-ad0d-19a2f184c89e\" width=270 />\n<img alt=\"photo_3_2024-05-22_11-17-19\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/170545146/52e98695-360d-47ab-bc68-e16bd0c1235f\" width=294 />\n<img alt=\"photo_4_2024-05-22_11-17-19\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/170545146/ad0d7a1e-6e51-49a0-b0a4-2774bacab249\" width=294 />\n<img alt=\"photo_5_2024-05-22_11-17-19\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/170545146/bdcb45c6-d3ac-4131-84e4-273934516157\" width=270 />\n",

The issue I'm facing is that sometimes, some of the channels I follow, upload a video that will be available in N days or M hours.\n\nI think NewPipe do not handle this elegantly, as all the time i refresh the feed, those videos will be listed on the top. A feature I'd like to have is the possibility to hide those videos until they are out, and make them appear when they are available.\n\n### Why do you want this feature?\n\nDue to the way I use the app, having videos that will be available only in the future always on top of the feed list makes my feed kind of confusing.\n\n### Additional information\n\nIn the screenshot, I'd like to hide the first video marked as \"One week from now\"\n\n<img alt=\"Screenshot_20240229-200856_NewPipe\" src=\"https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/assets/62906444/3fb55e52-128f-4be0-83cf-6b8129407a28\" width=270 />\n",

Now the error page shows video name but no video link. A replicable and clickable link is useful for users who want to use other app or browser to watch the video. The error page does not show any interpretative statements for the error state, which may make users feel helpless.\n\nWe can improve user experience and reduce probable duplicate and useless reports by adding a realtime announcement in the error page.\n\n### Additional information\n\nYou may create a text file that recording some urgent announcements on GitHub. When some systemmatic error happens, just let the client try to access the file and show it to users.",

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n#### What feature do you want?\nSet the required Android version to 5 aka Android API 21 aka Android \"Lollipop\" or higher.\n\nWhen creating a new project Android Studio currently recommends Android 6 / API 23.\n\nI personally would drop support for everything that doesn't runs Android 7 / API 24, because nearly 90% (← keep in mind that this number will only increase) of all devices run Android 7+.\n\nBtw: I think it would also be nice to declare/state somewhere that phones - which are using a newer Android version than provided by the original manufacturer - are not (officially) supported by us.\nExample: The [OnePlus One](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php) was originally updateable to Android 6 until the manufacturer dropped support for this phone. However if a user now installs a Custom ROM e.g. Android 11 and nothing works because the Hardware doesn't support some features which NewPipe (or ExoPlayer) requires and opens issues we are off the hook.\n\n#### Why do you want this feature?\n* Drop specialties (in the code) for old devices/Android versions.\nSome examples:\n  * https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/ee19ea66b3f4f182f78634c2d791dab6cab77257/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/MainActivity.java#L134-L137\n  * Media tunneling can be enabled by default\n  * SAF checks for Android 4.4 can be removed\n  * tons of other stuff see also https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/search?l=Java&q=KITKAT and https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/search?q=LOLLIPOP\n* Less ``Call requires API level X (current min is 19): ...``-warnings\n* We can close some (annoying) \"doesn't work on my 7+ year old phone or set's it on fire\"-issues\n* Currently we can't update ~ExoPlayer as ``2.15+`` [requires Android API 21+](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/releases/tag/r2.15.0)~ OkHttp https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/ee19ea66b3f4f182f78634c2d791dab6cab77257/app/build.gradle#L233-L234\n* According to Android Studio's \"Android Platform/API Version Distribution\" nearly 90% of all devices run on Android 7+\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40789489/147830366-9b7205f2-670f-4451-ba44-51306a50d9a0.png)\n* Everything running not at least Android 9+ (API 28+) is getting no more security patches (from Google itself - depends in the end on the manufacturer): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history\n\nFor comparison: [Android <4.4 support drop issue](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/1871)",

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n#### What feature do you want?\n<!-- Explain how you want the app's look or behavior to change to suit your needs. -->\nWhen a downloaded video is being played, I want an option added to the three-dot menu. Currently, there are only two options there (loop and help/feedback). I want an additional button that says \"pop-up/pop-out.\"\nTalking about the thing in the top-right of the player.\n![Screenshot_20211012-005813](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2876300/136894431-9cb04541-847d-430e-85ae-0dafc6cde793.png)\n\nThe new option should have identical functionality to the button \"Pop out\" shown here on the live YouTube browser part of the app and can reuse code. Feel free to make it a separate button instead of a drop-down depending on your UX goals.\n![Screenshot_20211012-010324](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2876300/136894892-cb4b09d9-aaa8-43a8-ae67-1dbbd7bf2633.png)\n\n\n#### Why do you want this feature?\n<!-- Describe any problem or limitation you come across while using the app which would be solved by this feature. -->\nI want this feature because I make very heavy use of both the download functionality (I ride subways and predownloading videos is the best way to avoid interruptions) and also the pop-out since I am a multitask addict. Combining these two features seems like a minor oversight that could be easily fixed, since both already exist in the codebase. It would make this app a 10/10 slam dunk for me and I would delete the native YouTube app.\n\nGreat job with this app by the way, already 9/10 and has become my go-to client in under a week, love that it is open source.",

Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->\nI'd like the clickable area of the buttons on bottom minimized video overlay (or how it's properly called) to be matching the height of the overlay.\n\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.\nExample: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->\nThe way buttons are currently configured isn't very ergonomic in my opinion. Their clickable area is kinda too small to tap, especially for users who have curved screen corners and don't use on screen navigation bar (like myself). I often (blindly) go for the bottom corner of the screen to close a video but end up bringing it back to the main player because there's some room below the button. Perhaps it looks better for some people the way it is, or there's some functional reason for it which I'm not aware of (?), but it seems to me that my suggestion would be ok to be implemented. I've already tried it on my phone and works well (it's rather simple anyway). So I could open a PR for it.\n\n\n#### Additional context\n<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.\nExample: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->\n![Screenshot_20210923-123035012~01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45879751/134492656-d67f52b9-efff-4406-bd19-7f0ea901d9b9.jpg)\n\n#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?\n<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?\nThe better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.\nExample: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->\nI guess this would improve reachability of these buttons for other users too.\n",

Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->\nIn Third-Party Licenses:\n1. Single click shows `licenses dialog` directly and long click shows a `popup menu` with only two options.(here I think the Long Click action is useless)\n=> I think (instead of long click) it would be better to have single click show the `popup menu` and user can choose to goto website or show licenses dialog.(Picture 1)\n\n2. And the title of `popup menu` feels like its the clickable item (though it is UPPERCASE, it doesnot standout)\n=> My suggestions are using different background tint for title and list items of `popup menu`  OR removing the title, because there is ripple animation already to give user feedback.(Picture 2)\n\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.\nExample: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->\nI wanted to know what was the purpose of those libraries, and clicked to know about it. But only the license dialog was showing. I didn't know about the long press to show `popup menu` existed. So, I google searched each entry on the list and read their corresponding Github description.\n \n\n\n#### Additional context\n<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.\nExample: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->\n![long_press](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50160188/118273215-6a5d3000-b4e3-11eb-997d-cf2bef6515e1.PNG)\n\n![no_title](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50160188/118273260-73e69800-b4e3-11eb-96eb-f7ab9e6c8638.PNG)\n\n\n\n#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?\n<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?\nThe better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.\nExample: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->\nIn future, May be someone want to know about the library used in the app and want to directly goto corresponding Github page in just single click.\n",

Player tabs on full screen should be swipable just like how they are on main player. So, seek position gesture should not work here. Video tabs' buttons and close button (floating on bottom right corner) should appearonly while scrolling content up. No need to show those buttons all the time.\n\n\nFull screen tabs should be presented as following screenshot no matter which theme is selected. Each comment, segment and part of description should be presented in such curved parts. Applying dark theme on these parts will turn things weird. Unlike the screenshot, the contents should be placed on the right and each part should be curved on all four sides.\n![IMG_20210421_172849](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79245641/115547602-433a8680-a2c8-11eb-9834-5244eb906eeb.jpg)\n\nOne more thing, these tabs should be hidden while showing the video interface.\n\nTranscript tab: On the top of this tab, there should be two drop-down menus.\n1. Captions\n2. Audio tracks\nJust like chapters, 'Transcript' should let us enter a certain timestamp. Unlike captions, it should only include the starting point of each segment.

Unfortunately, users can't choose an option for once at a time. Please be noted that these checkboxes will have to be checked or unchecked before choosing a playback option. These checkboxes should be kept unchecked by default.\n\n1. Both unchecked: Same as 'Just once'\n2. Checked \"Remember my choice\": Same as 'Always'\n3. Checked \"Remember my choice until app is manually closed\": If the notification player or the app from recent apps is not manually closed, the app will remember the playback option.\n\nChecking both options won't be possible as that doesn't make any sense.

But the interface always has to be opened. An \"Always-on button\" can do all these things within a single tap. However, it might be disturbing for some users while streaming. So, an option to hide it should be kept too.\n\n\nThis option might be added optional in settings for every single type of playback. 1. Background, 2. Popup, 3. Full screen and 4. Main menu. This will make switching much easier. For background, always-on button on the bottom right corner of the media player functions.\n\nIf a single action for the button, single tap on \"Always-on button\" should directly perform that action. However, if multiple actions are selected, always-on pallet will be shown.\n![IMG_20210314_125908](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79245641/111061776-1f1ca600-84cf-11eb-98f1-22a76044a17f.jpg)\n\nTapping once again on the centre button of the pallet or always-on button should close the pallet.\n\nI think more than four options will make the UI too overcrowded. So, it should be limited to four. However, users should be able to choose between one, two, three or four actions.\n\nPositions for the options of always-on pallet should be customisable just like the options for Content on Main Page\n\nAlways-on button should be stay hidden when the video is locked or video interface is shown.\n\n Following options will be helpful.\n1. Pause/Resume: First tap will pause the video, show always-on button pallet (if pallet is supposed to stay) and hide video interface Tapping elsewhere the pallet will hide the pallet Video interface should never be shown as that is what never meant to be shown.\n2. Pause+Take screenshot/Resume: First tap will pause the video and take the screenshot of the current time. The screenshot will not be stretched or zoomed or show the buttons. Rather, it should be alike an original shot directly from the video. The options in next screenshot might be added while taking screenshot. A checkbox for \"Delete after sharing\" should be added above the screenshot pallet. It should stay unchecked by default. A \"Screenshot\" tab should be included in the options drawer as well.\n![IMG_20210314_140925](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79245641/111061730-ef6d9e00-84ce-11eb-95fb-ad689e2782c3.jpg)\n3. Switch to background\n4. Switch to popup\n5. Switch to full screen\n6. Switch to main\n7. Loop: First tap will be regarded as starting point. Second tap will be regarded as ending point and the selected part will be looped.\n8. Repeat: Three options (1. Don't repeat, 2. Repeat only this, 3. Repeat All) will be added just like media player functions for background.\n9. Lock: First tap will lock the screen and place the \"Unlock\" button on the top left corner. However, always-on button's previous position should not get changed. It should be hidden while locked. But it will return to its previous place when the video is unlocked.\n10. Fit/Fill/Zoom: This option should fit or fill or zoom the video in cyclic order just how as we do on video interface. Single tap for fit, double tap for fill, tripple tap for zoom, fourth tap for fit again and so on. \n11. Choose playback speed 1X, a.bcX, d.efX: Actually, most of us need only certain playback speed options. For example, I watch my news videos at 1.75X, but I watch music videos at 1X speed. It should also follow the cyclic order of fit/fill/zoom. Speed options should stay unhooked. a.bcX, d.efX, p.qrX etc. options should be customisable by the user.\n12. Share video URL\n13. Share video URL at current time\n14. Download\n15 Open with browser\n16. Open with external player\n17. Choose captions\n18. Search with the captions: Really useful if captions are not downloaded but user still wants to listen to a basic part.\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem?

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n\n#### Describe the feature you want\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.\nExample: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*\n\nOptionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.\nExample: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->\n\"Created playlists\" tab should be brought in order to keep playlists created by the user. This will help reduce conflict and keep all the playlists in a proper way. Others' playlists should be kept in \"Bookmarked playlists\".\n\n\nDownloaded playlists: Each playlist should have download time (from when the download started) grayed out (just like channel name under video). There should be 4 tabs within each playlist. Default sorting for playlist could be \"Recent\" (just like downloads).\nAll: Show all videos as a usual playlist, just with download and remove date and time under the title bar. This tab should be exclusive for changing positions of videos as creating changes in other tabs may cause conflicts.\nDownloaded: Show downloadeded and offline available videos. \"Download\" option in long press menu should still remain as other resolutions might be required. File will be replaced automatically if same resolution for same file is selected. Recent downloaded file should appear at first in the playlist by default.\nRemoved: Once downloaded, later file removed from the device. However, the files should be accessed through online, not offline. If the files are opened online, they should play on the same resolution as they would if remain downloaded.\nNot downloaded: Saved under the playlist, but not downloaded.\n\nDownloaded playlist should not get affected (Affects include removal of videos, adding videos by original playlist). Rather, it should be regarded as a new and independent playlist. Downloaded playlists should not get imported or exported. (We see the same for \"Downloads\" menu). Unlike created playlists, new videos cannot be added in downloaded playlists.\n\nVideos selected through bulk selection or single video download should be included in downloaded playlists. Instead, if a user downloads the playlist from long press menu (mentioned in #5782) that playlist should be considered for downloaded playlist.\n\nA checkbox above the download selection page could be added.for confirmation. It should be checked by default. Sorry for my poor editing.\n![IMG_20210410_150153](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79245641/114264612-beb94f80-9a0d-11eb-8683-6929c74c5d9b.jpg)\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, only last modifications before first download of the playlists should be included for \"Downloaded playlists\" However, downloading videos from the \"Downloaded playlist\" should include downloaded videos.\n\n\"Downloaded playlists\" and \"Downloaded files\" should be two different menus. They should have separate downloads. They should not get mixed up.\n\nIt should have variable grid options (Same as \"Downloads\") for both playlists and videos.\n\nThree dots menu for playlist and long press menu for playlist and video should be as same as for downloaded playlists just like created playlists.\n\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Somehow, we need all videos but have chosen to the wrong action for a few videos. The case might be opposite too. We want to select all videos. But the actions will be performed in seperate ways. In such cases, swiping left and right gestures might be helpful. Screenshots are here for better understanding my need. Sorry for my bad editing.\n\nMost people will prefer swiping right for removing videos. However, there are left handed people too. This is why, both swiping left and right should be customisable for different actions.\n\n\nIn my opinion, basic functions include\n1. Remove\n2. Download\n3. Add to popup\n4. Add to background\n5. Add to main\n6. Add to playlist\n7. Share\n\nUsers may need to do same actions with selected videos. That's why, bulk selection menu should be dismissed only after choosing 'Close' (or 'Cancel') option.\n\nOnce bulk selection is activated, an easy video selection gesture should be usable. This gesture could activate bulk selection as well. The reason why I want to keep long press on bulk selection is that users may want a simple common gesture as different views have different gestures.\n\nFor list and 1×1 grid view: Scroll through thumbnails\nFor grid view: Swipe through the videos with two fingers continuously.\n\nThe positions of selected videos should be readjustable just like playlists or enqeued lists.\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Somehow, we need all videos but have chosen to the wrong action for a few videos. The case might be opposite too. We want to select all videos. But the actions will be performed in seperate ways. In such cases, swiping left and right gestures might be helpful. Screenshots are here for better understanding my need. Sorry for my bad editing.\n\nMost people will prefer swiping right for removing videos. However, there are left handed people too. This is why, both swiping left and right should be customisable for different actions.\n\nIf one action on a single swipe, the action should immediately take place. If multiple actions are selected, shortcut icons for the functions should be displayed.\n\nIn my opinion, basic functions include\n1. Remove\n2. Download\n3. Play on popup\n4. Play on background\n5. Play on full screen\n6. Play with video info\n7. Add to playlist\n8. Copy link\n\nOne more thing, \"Enqueue on background\", \"Enqueue on popup\", \"Download all\" and \"Add all to playlist\" in the three dots menu alongside currently available functions.\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem?

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n\n#### Describe the feature you want\nThanks for this great app (v0.20.8)\nI have some suggestions to make the Andoid TV UI better, this because the current NewPipe UI is optimized for smartphone/tablet use and not for a TV with a remote controller.\nSo here are some points of interest to tweak the UI for Andoid TV's:\n- Add a setting to \"force\" Andoid TV UI with:\n\t- Removing number 1 and 2 and place them in the menu (pic 2);\n\t- Sadly I am unable to close a video I watched (number 3), so remove this or add a new function (press back to make it small, press back again to close);\n\t- When you are on one of the videos on the left (pic 1, eg Michou) and than press left, it should open the menu as in pic2;\n\t- Playing a video in fullscreen is quite hard to do, so is it possible to make somekind of button in the video pop-up to play a video fullscreen?. maybe also add these: (back 10sec, full screen/small screen, pauze,close video, advance 10sec. when pressing down it should go to the timeline of the video) ; \n\t- If possible, add a feature to update the app from wihtin newpipe. My TV sucks when using a browser and does not give me the pup-up for a new version...;\n\t- Refressing the playlist is also hard to do, I suggest making a \"long press to refresh\" function to refresh the playlist.\n\n![np1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76731207/103280141-ebea7080-49cf-11eb-8ace-3e637859475b.png)\n![np2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76731207/103280157-f3aa1500-49cf-11eb-80b8-6cbeb99c75b4.png)\n\n\nIf someone could have a look at these points for any future update would be great, I am willing to test the alpha version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\nI noticed that from two versions back the \"add to background queue\" option disappeared from share the context menu. I often browse the YouTube application and when I find interesting material that I would like to listen to later in Newpipe, I add it to the queue.  \n\nUntil recently, I could add any number of video to the queue, but since the two previous updates, I can only listen one video at a time. Sharing new one will remove previously added material from qieue. \n\nI would like to kindly ask you to restore the add to background queue function to share context menu. I think that this functionality should not be too difficult to implement, at the same time it seems quite important not only for me, but also for all users of the application.\n\n![IMG_20201212_213940](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3338469/101994834-e3065900-3cc5-11eb-94cd-785f86ef0651.jpg)\n![IMG_20201212_214111](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3338469/101994835-e4378600-3cc5-11eb-9183-10f6bd805bc1.jpg)\n\n",

I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n\n#### Describe the feature you want\nVertical swiping currently allows us to adjust brightness and volume.\n\nVLC also has horizontal swiping to seek back and forward in the video. It also shows how far you're seeking, eg `+10 (1:10)` or `-15 (0:45)`\n\nThis would be a handy feature!\n\nPic of VLC video controls:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/101306827-07af9a80-389a-11eb-8fbd-f133a59fe8c1.png)\n\n#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?\nThis will make seeking easier, more accessible (currently to seek you have to tap the screen, then fiddle with the small seek bar) and more accurate. I realise it may not be easy to show live previews when seeking on YouTube videos, but at least we could easily see how many seconds/minutes we're jumping to). Thanks!\n",

You can verify it by seeking the seekbar and check if there is a delay (visually). I recommend these two videos for testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTJcASRxbfI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY\nThey haven't got that great delay and therefore the UI should response better (less jerky) than on most over videos with this build.\n\n#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?\n<!-- Convince us!

Open NewPipe app on an Android Desktop environment\n2. Try to resize it\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nResizing is possible\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nIt's not resizable via dragging borders or corners and the resizing button is greyed out\n\n### Screenshots/Screen recordings\n\nAs you can see the resizing button is greyed out:\n![NewPipe on Samsung DeX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372620/88523995-16876600-cff9-11ea-9462-8084d886ba03.jpg)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm using [Samsung DeX](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/dex/), which gives a desktop like experience and makes use of Android windowing support.\n\n[Samsung has documentation on how to enable window resizing](https://developer.samsung.com/samsung-dex/modify-optimizing.html):\n\n```xml\n<application\n    android:resizeableActivity=\"true\">\n</application>\n```\n\nThis documentation also has more tweaks and information on how to improve the desktop experience in case you're interested.\nThey also have [an app testing guide](https://developer.samsung.com/samsung-dex/testing.html) (although some apps are fine with this guide but won't work on \"real\" DeX sometimes).\n\nApplications like Firefox, VLC or Termux can be resized without any problems.\n\n**PS:** I know that it is possible to _force_ all apps to be resizable via `Samsung Labs` > `Force Resize` but it would obviously better to make the application natively resizable to create less friction.\n**PPS:** I'm not sure whether this is relevant but [this](https://codeberg.org/gitnex/GitNex/pulls/601/files) is how GitNex fixed the issue.\n**PPPS:** There's also [this blog post](https://blog.iamsuleiman.com/prepare-apps-multi-window-in-android-n/) that looks helpful.",

    "title": "Design proposals",
    "body": "First of all: NewPipe is so great! I really like it so my criticism is \"Grumbling at a high level\" as we say in Germany. NewPipe looks good. But I want it to look _**best**_. So I've decided to make the following design proposals. Unfortunately, I have no clue how to design an Android app so I can only contribute some example images.\n\n# **1) Better context menu** \nIn my opinion, it takes the user too long to understand what all the options mean. The context menu lacks good distinguishability of the individual items. So this is my proposal: add icons, group the items and put the share option as an icon to the top. Also, the video title needs to be really emphazised because it just gets kinda lost. By the way: those are Bootstrap icons. I created the last 2 ones myself from existing ones.  And maybe make the edges more rounded.\n\n![NewPipe new context menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52963327/88476588-fdaf7f80-cf28-11ea-96db-bdc164937398.png)\n\n# **2) Swipe to delete home tab**\nYou can delete a home tab by dragging/sliding it in the settings to the right out of the window. There should be a red indicator.\n\n![NewPipe swipe to delete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52963327/88468764-de3c3680-ced7-11ea-92a3-2fa93138fb3b.png)\n\n# **3) PeerTube instances**\nIn the left menu you can select PeerTube as the video source. But if you have several PeerTube instances NewPipe gives you this little really annoying dropdown menu which I'd like to have replaced by a grouped/seperated list.\n\n![NewPipe PeerTube](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52963327/88468846-bbf6e880-ced8-11ea-9ee5-4635bc47c08a.png)\n\n# **4) Pull to refresh**\nPlease add the option to pull-refresh the feed tab. Searching and unsuccessfully tapping the little, little reload button is sooo annoying.\n\n![NewPipe pull to refresh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52963327/88468880-2f005f00-ced9-11ea-8d16-a09bf1d240d6.png)\n\nThanks for your work!

    "title": "Unify playback queues and notifications for background/pop-up player",
    "body": "#### Context\nIf a video is started in the background and another video is started in the pop-up player, there are two playback notifications. When the user taps on the notifications, they can view the two different playback queues for the background and the pop-up player.\n\n![20200604_102633](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61639215/83733507-e69d9100-a64d-11ea-8acb-f4367aa325d6.jpg)\n\n\n#### Feature request\nMerge the two queues for the background and the pop-up player into a single one that is used for all playback modes.\nShow the same notification for the pop-up player as for background playback. When a video is started in a different playback mode (background/pop-up) or the playback mode is switched, the notification has to control the player (background or pop-up player) that is currently playing.\nI.e. if the pop-up player is open all the time but a video is started in background mode, from that point the notification has to change to the video that is played in the background until the pop-up playback is continued.\n\n\n#### User benefit\nUsually, every media player has a playback queue. But not more than one. It's known to the users and expected that way. It's convenient because it's simple, common and it doesn't work any worse.\nThere is just no point in having multiple playback queues for one app that can only play one video at a time. It's only extra load that doesn't bring any advantage.\n\nThe same explanation applies for the duplicate playback notification. Currently, two notifications are necessary to access the different playback queues. Beyond that, it's only annoying that basically the same notification can be displayed twice while at the same time only one of them has an actual purpose. It doesn't make any sense that the pop-up player notification is different. It misses the skip buttons and the progress bar. Apart from that there is no difference, so it could as well be only one notification.\n\n#### Related problems\nThe disadvantages described in this issue are related to a different problem in issue 'Background/pop-up/full-screen players open at the same time' #3737.\nIn that issue I stated that it's unnecessary to have different players open at the same time, as only one can play at a time, anyway. The fact that pop-up player and background playback can be open simultaneously is the condition for the two notifications showing up at the same time. Still, it is an independent problem that there are two different notifications in the first place.\nAlso the transition from which playback mode is controlled by a single notification (background or pop-up mode) would be easier if their was only one playback mode open at a time.",

    "title": "Fast actions from mini info item - UI / UX ideas",
    "body": "# Problem\nI have been thinking about the long press menu lately, and I realized it is inconvenient because:\n1. Entries have no corresponding icon, so our eyes can't distinguish between two entries at the first sight.\n2. Entries are not always in the same position on the screen, so we can't use muscle memory. Even though this was partially addressed by #2354 & #2368, the position of entries depends anyway on the menu length.\n3. There are too many entries, making the menu too crowded, and there are many requests for new entries (#437 #2198 #2510 #1142).\n4. There is no way to select multiple streams and apply an action on all of them.\n\n# Solution\nThis is the solution I propose, sorry for the bad quality ;-)\n\n![menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36421898/64062305-08607800-cbe5-11e9-97d1-7e9ea0f9a6cd.jpg)\n\nScreen A contains normal info item list. By tapping on the blue *stream* info item we get to screen B. Yes, video info is not loaded, instead the item expands to show some action buttons above and below it! Here is why I think this is a good idea:\n- Most of the times when I click on a video I just want to play it, and currently I have to wait for video info to load before being able to play anything (#2306). With this solution it would take less time.\n- Video info can be loaded by clicking again on the item.\n- Icons are always in the same place (relative to the clicked stream) and with the same icon (no text, as icons are representative enough). This solves problems 1. and 2. above. Also, actions about stream content (play&download) are separated from the specific ones that only use stream info (add-to-playlist, share, delete-from-playlist, set-as-playlist-thumbnail, etc.).\n- Since play-actions are displayed where the item was before, and the item is shifted down (see how the above separator is not moved in screen B), one can remember where an option is and double-tap in the correct place directly from screen A. This would take no time.\n- Background and popup play buttons can be long-pressed to enqueue (consistent with the video info activity).\n- There is place for new actions, in case we ever need them. We would just need to add a button to the bar below the item.\n\nBy long-pressing on the blue *stream* info item on screen A, the multiple-select options are shown in the action bar (similar to https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2354#issuecomment-494871457), solving the problem 4. above. By tapping once on any other *stream* info items we can select them, getting to situation C. A tick is displayed above selected items' thumbnails and the action bar is populated with actions about stream content.\nThe three-dot menu cointains the other actions and also two options useful for selection purposes: \"select below\" and \"select above\", only available in non-infinite lists. These can be considered a replacement to a \"select all\" button, but are more powerful and would solve #2510 #2559. If a playlist is long and is not fully loaded, the \"select below\" button would lazily select all items so that they are loaded only if needed. \n\n# Feedback\nI would implement this but I need feedback both from designers and from users. Would this idea suit your needs? Would it be pleasant to the eye? If you disagree with any of the assumptions I made above, be sure to tell me ;-)\n\n@theScrabi @TobiGr @TheAssassin @nv95 @Gymcap @karyogamy @justanidea @Lirlisa @gkeegan @BartFarley @xak2000 @jojoxl01",

By applying __``Stream \\ StreamHistory``__ you can find the so called Orphanes. These are streams that are not yet in the history but still listed in the streams table. @karyogamy  Maybe these can be used to indicate not yet seen videos.\n\n### Preperations on detecting the time\nSince time on youtube videos is a little complicated to parse the NewPipe Extractor always returned the creation time of a video as a String not as a number. This however makes it complicated if you want to track the time for a feed database. Luckily @mauriciocolli created the [time ago parser](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/tree/master/timeago-parser) project with which is possible to convert the Youtube time ago strings into rough time estimations.\n\nAlso for some youtube channels a RSS feed is available, however wee still need a fallback because not all channels have RSS.\n\n### What still needs to be done\n- [x] Well the extractor still returns a String for the time, so the time ago parser should be used for youtube to return a `long` instead.\n- [x] The [StreamEntity](https://github.com/teamnewpipe/newpipe/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/database/stream/model/StreamEntity.java) needs to get a row with the creation date.",

    "body": "I'm sorry I merged the livestream feature before it got tested.\nSo here are some thoughts and impressions of mine:\n\n- [x] __New instead of Sync__\nOn the player if you have live stream, on the right side you see the word Sync. However I found it a little more conveniend and intuitive if it was called Now instead.\n![sync](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/37354284-9381a77e-26e1-11e8-82ae-972f9512e928.png)\n\n\n- [x] __New streams shouldn't start at the beginning but on \"now\"__\nAs a noop I expect a live stream to be \"live\" when i start it. However it confused me that the live stream starts at the beginning and not at the \"now\". It took me some time until I realized the picture I saw was not \"now\", and I had to scroll forward.  However I witnessed that when I lock and unlock the phone we are \"live\" again.\n![start_at_beginning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/37354331-afaa0392-26e1-11e8-8709-dcfa72e44f65.png)\n\n- [x] __Confusing display where we are in the stream__\nAlso the number showing where we are currently in the stream jumpt arround wildly, even sometimes jumping to a minus value. That confused me.\n![confusing_display](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1891273/37354353-bf04eea6-26e1-11e8-9486-8964ea1b11a3.png)\n",

But i think it is usefull that the share menu has differents icons for the normal mode and the popup-mode, so you can see with one look which mode you choose.\n\n\nhere is an example:\n![screenshot_2017-09-18-12-15-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3259510/30542156-8030da52-9c7e-11e7-91c2-6abb5698699f.jpg)\n\n \n\n",

Thank's for your work.\n> Btw do we already have ideas for NewPipe's GUI? I was thinking about something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/CbAfzsC.gifv).\n\nSince tabs will be introduced with TeamNewPipe/NewPipe#620 soon, another bar on the top of the screen doesn't seem to be a good solution to me. I thought a little about this problem and found two possible solutions:\n\n1. **Refactor the search filter menu:** remove the old list and add clickable items. This gives the user the possibility to search for things in Youtube _and_ SoundCloud at the same time.\n![search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28756762-0727cb00-7575-11e7-88d8-34ad76bb44ad.jpg)\nFirst sketch: default search bar Second sketch: Search bar after clicking on the filter icon (maybe the filter icon should not disappear to be accessible for further actions). The clickable items should have different background colors depending on their state.\n\n2. **Add navigation drawer to app:** replace the old menu in the app bar by a navigation drawer. This solution gives the app a more modern look and separates all services.\n![design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28756763-072e3a80-7575-11e7-809c-e655a608861c.jpg)",
