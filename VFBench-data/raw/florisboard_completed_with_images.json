When adjusting the size:\n\n- Word suggestions, Emoji and its name text both change size together\n- Chinese characters and their English transliteration below change size together\n\n**In previous snygg version:**\n\n- Emoji metadata text was proportionally smaller than the emoji itself\n- Similar size differentiation existed for Chinese input suggestions\n\n**Separate the size controls to allow different sizing for:**\n\n- Primary content (word suggestions/emojis, Chinese characters)\n- Secondary content (metadata descriptions, transliterations)\n\nor idk, maybe make secondary content automatically X times smaller then primary. For example, the padding/margin of the `smartbar-candidate-row` needed to be removed to prevent the secondary text from being cropped with desired primary content font-size.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Screenshots</summary>\n<h3> Left: snygg v1, Right: snygg v2 </h3><br/>\n<div style=\"display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 2vw; width: fit-content;\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f83d273-0844-4362-8f5b-f4a6aef95a20\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76a4e2db-a086-4b04-b249-067f1928f74c\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39a54012-7586-44d9-889c-740491a10a6e\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fce0da2-d1d7-4bc2-9f06-7fa944ba91af\" width=\"48%\"/>\n</div>\n</details>\n\n## Tiles\nSimilar behaviour with tiles text vs icon size.

    "title": "Enhancements for Theme Engine (Snygg)",
    "body": "I am aware that there are more pressing matters here, but let this suggestion stand for consideration, and perhaps it will be addressed at some point.\n\nNamely, the theme editor you've conceived and created is something truly unique, unlocking creativity, and I thank you all guys for enabling such extensive keyboard personalization.\n\nWhile creating a Gboard-like UI, I encountered a few things that I couldn't resolve, and it might be useful to add in general:\n\n**1.  Add properties for `padding`, `margin`, `gap`**\n- Somewhere, I managed to simulate the gap between elements with `border-width` and `border-color` (like in `action key tails`, `sticky action key`, etc.). However, this doesn't always have the desired impact or doesn't work at all, or the element doesn't support those properties. Besides, using borders for spacing is a bit of a silly solution on its own, I admit ü•≤\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**2.  Separate the design of `action keys` from `sticky action key`**\n- If a sticky key (e.g., micüéôÔ∏è) has a specific design, perhaps someone doesn't want their sticky key to be a mic but incognito or something else, and reordering them using the `Reorder Actions` button, the design remains bland for the mic, and it looks inconsistent when the key with the sticky design is moved to the `action row`. Also, the new key that is now in place of the `sticky action key` does not have the desired sticky design. Huh, if you managed to understand anything of what I said.\n\n![florisboard--sticky-action-key](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/assets/44645238/47f89341-2b6f-4184-bb52-16fcf964d74e)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**3.  Enable change value of `font-size` in `action keys tail`**\n- The `font-size` property exists there, but adding any value doesn't seem to have an impact, or perhaps I'm doing something wrong?\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**4.  Perhaps implement `font-weight` property?**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**5.  Consistent `height`/`padding` in the keyboard footer?**\n- I'm not sure what this is related to, but when using a borderless theme, the submit button and space have a smaller height (or padding) than keys `?123`/`ABC` (`-202`/`-201`). While in the theme editor, it looks as it should, but when using the keyboard, somehow the height/padding decreases.\n\n![florisboard--footer-height](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/assets/44645238/9bc8b101-a97b-4d7f-8f42-ad0a79f20055)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n**6.  Separate design for all elements of the num layout.**\n- Separate design from keys when the num layout is only displayed because if we want to change the design for characters `+`, `(`, `)`, `-`, `%`, `=`, etc., they will be altered on every layout, and that seems odd. But I understand if this might be complicated to implement/rewrite.\n\n![florisboard--num-layout](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/assets/44645238/936ce1ba-61d0-4cef-b242-101ebbd1c80a)\n![florisboard--num-character](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/assets/44645238/b318e3c0-93c5-4579-9308-c09ff9cd1f2f)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are some more nuances, but I won't overburden you with them now.",

I've been using your keyboard for several months and I have no issues so far. I like its Backup/Restore feature because it doesn't need to reconfigure everything manually when I want to reinstall or use it to my other devices from scratch.\n\nAnd I think it would be better if you add Clipboard History as well (text-based clipboard) to be a part of backup/restore checkbox in Advanced settings, like for the Pinned and Other categories if possible. By adding that, we don't need to recopy or readd text everything to clipboard and re-pin what I want in particular order.\n\nThank you very much for this keyboard development!",

I could not find a way to disable it in settings. Smartbar, suggestions, spell checker, and user dictionaries are turned off.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Update Florisboard to 0.3.16 from 0.3.15.\n2. Click on a text field.\n3. Start typing.\n4.

As I am often in linguistic discussions, I find it helpful to have a keyboard for it.\n\nI suggest not following Gboard's example, whose layout spreads over four pages with all vowels on the second page and thus unpleasant to use. I have two suggestions for implementation:\n\n- Use QWERTY layout, make the input based on [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) (sorry I don't have a visual for it)\n  - the default key is like normal QWERTY\n  - after pressing Shift, each key returns the equivalent IPA symbols encoded by X-SAMPA\n    - e.g. `Shift` + `s` ‚Üí x/S/ ‚Üí  É\n  - All keys' variants can be accessed by holding the key (e.g. hold s --> show x/S/  É, x/s\\/ …ï, x/s`/  Ç)\n  - Symbols encoded by non-alphanumeric characters in X-SAMPA (which usually don't represent consonants nor vowels) are in the special character input.\n- Use X11 keyboard layout, like in the below picture. In each key:\n  - the bottom left is the default key\n  - the top left is the key after pressing Shift\n  - the other keys can be accessed by holding the key\n  - characters that don't look like a letter (which usually don't represent consonants nor vowels) can be put in the special character input.\n\n![X11 layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19296926/113422183-78089b80-93f6-11eb-9145-28bbc030ddb3.png)\n",

I think that it would be good if the icons for backspace/enter follow the same size as the font size multiplier. I currently have my font size set at 90%, but the icons look massive and don't change. By making the icons scale with the rest of the letters would make the keyboard look more consistant and overall better. \n\nHeres the large icons here:\n![Keyboard here with the large icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46629504/113147342-96b93780-9228-11eb-8d85-e54bc54b0f1e.jpg)\n",

I didn't quiete understand what those options even meant. So here's some ideas for renaming things:\n#### Improvements:\n1. Change \"Key Switch Mode\" to something like \"Emoji-button Settings\"\n**Reason:** This actually tells users what we're changing the options for.\n2. Rename the Options to something similar to those:\n  - \"No Emoji-Button\"\n  **Reason:** Nobody knows what the so called switch is.\n  - \"Default (Emoji-Button)\"\n  **Reason:** The \"Switch\" bothers me.\nThis is the standart-option, right? The Default should probably be at the top of the list.\n  - I don't think most users understand what internal vs system mean. So if this is how it works, i suggest renaming the two language switch options to something like \"Switch Language\" and \"Switch Keyboard-App\"\n  - Rename the last option in accordance to what the previous options are called (after renaming them)",

Because \"insert space\" doesn't insert `space` when releasing the space-bar. It triggers like a regular long-press.
