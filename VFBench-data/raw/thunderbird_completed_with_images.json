Or at least maybe, when a user has one account only, remove the accounts pane and bring back the refresh and settings buttons to the side panel?\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n_No response_",

There is a trend of phones being stolen while the owner has them unlocked, and they try not to click on the button to keep the screen on so they can access the data.\n\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nI'd like to propose a configuration option where I can set \"hide content\" even when the phone is unlocked. Some sites and apps have the option to change the password of your account by sending you an email with a link or sending you a code by email. If any of those, the link or the code is at the start of the email, it may show on the notification bar if the user expands the notification.\n\nSo, my final ask would be to create an option to show only the email subject at the notification.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\nCurrently, this is how that is: \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/assets/52160996/4b192920-c3f4-4e8a-8fc1-f40f8e1f4c72\" width=\"400\" />\n<img src=\"https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/assets/52160996/0a777f2f-e73e-46ac-af10-baa8fbd2267b\" width=\"400\" />\n\nI'd like to propose an option that simply doesn't allow the email to be expanded.

I don't know how this is done, I guess it must scan my email folders and create a database of email addresses, but this is SO HELPFUL as it is very common not to have everyone you want to email as a phone contact.\n\nThis would solve a major usability issue (certainly why I stopped using K-9 Mail) and common complain people have about not able to import contact easily in K-9 Mail. Also a good stop gap until syncing Thunderbird contact to K-9 Mail is possible (although even when this is possible, it will only be useful for those who use thunderbird already).\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nStudy how FairEmail does it, or ask the creator and reproduce the mechanism in K-9 Mail.\n\nSee below the settings in FairEmail related to this. Though just to be clear, it does add only contact you have emailed or received email from using the FairEmail app, but those already in your mail folders (inbox, sent, etc.).\n\n![Screenshot_2023-11-01-20-24-18-57_208213728eb6a732b32bf625e881f060](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/assets/18719956/8c1a6011-b67f-4eb9-ba69-e91e4265ffc6)\n\n",

It is currently possible to select several messages in the unified inbox and then delete them or archive them, but it is not possible to move them to a folder in a particular mailbox.\n\nI understand that this is probably due to the fact that it might seem strange to move mail from one mailbox in to a folder of another mailbox BUT this feature is available in other clients and it is useful. It can be viewed as an instant forward of a mail to yourself.\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nMy preffered solution for this would be to make it so that it is possible to move any piece of mail in the unified inbox in to any folder of any mailbox. However I would also think that it would be an improvement to be able to move multiple mails into a folder if and only if they are in the same mailbox (i.e. the move button could be greyed out if mails from several mailboxes were selected).\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![IMG_20230803_164804](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9/assets/1281830/51b97cd9-0890-4bf3-a2e2-ab172c3a1967)\n\nAdd a move button here.",

Since Android 10, Gesture based navigation took over the three button navigation in most devices as the default and <b>almost all users</b> have gotten used to it. This gesture based navigation collides with the swipe gesture to open the menu hence making it useless in <b>almost all usecases.</b>\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nHence, I would suggest to (re)move the hamburger button above the compose icon placed as a floating button.\nMatrix's flagship client recently redesigned their client where they changed the menu button and got great response from its users (infact the suggestion was actually made by the users). \nSo I have attached the images what I talk about, looking at the images I hope you will be able to understand.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![Element Menu Button](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9/assets/135484820/0b968fc6-f2a8-437f-b270-ad68a4975966)\n![Element Space Menu](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9/assets/135484820/7f1e633d-4989-4170-b126-d694da41fd0a)\n",

Stars are not green, brown or blue. They're always yellow, across the vast majority of the interfaces I ever used.\nSo I propose to leave them yellow as well, no matter the colour scheme used for other elements on K9 interface.\n\nBTW, the blinking prompter in compose view should be black, as the text it generates, not fuchsia, as it is now. :)\n\n### Suggested solution\n\n1. Make flag stars yellow, across the interface\n2. Make the compose blinking prompter black\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![Screenshot_20230211_175735_K-9 Mail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40858521/218268002-e632c439-b0e4-4762-81c8-f104bc3ea0e1.jpg)\n![Screenshot_20230211_175658_K-9 Mail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40858521/218268005-5ec9609d-d251-4404-bda8-8c4e90ba8221.jpg)\n",

These swipe actions are working pretty fine to mark or delete an e-mail.\nSadly when you delete an e-mail with the swipe action you can't undo it. I happens to me a few time, that I deleted a mail with the swipe action and can't undo it. I had to manually search the message in the trash folder.\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nWhen you delete a message with the swipe action, there should be a small message on the buttom of the screen to undo it. This message should disappear after a few secons. Like in gmail or outlook app for android.\nSee example screenshot below.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59510296/213211689-8ededdc4-5ae8-4126-9190-afbb6458be04.png)\n",

    "title": "Proper formatting when sending RTL/BiDi messages",
    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have used the search function to see if someone else has already submitted the same feature request.\n- [X] I will describe the problem with as much detail as possible.\n- [X] This issue only contains a request for one single feature, **not** multiple (related) features.\n\n### App version\n\n6.400\n\n### Problem you are trying to solve\n\nI'd like to be able to send messages containing RTL/BiDi text, which will be rendered correctly by the receiver. Currently, when I send such messages, they render correctly only in k9 itself (and that only under specific circumstances), but not, e.g., in Gmail.\n\nIt's actually a bit complicated, so bear with me...\n\nRTL languages (such as Hebrew / Arabic / Persian) are written right-to-left -- this refers both to the fact that the text is aligned to the right rather than to the left, as well as the fact that the second letter of a word is written to the left of  the first letter, and the second word is written to the left of the first word, etc. When mixing RTL and LTR text in the same paragraph, things are even more complicated. Proper rendering of such text is done by the BiDi (bidirectional) algorithm. Specifically (and simplifying a bit), part of the algorithm is that the paragraph direction is determined by the language of the first character.\n\nIn the following examples, \"אבג\" is the first logical word, with its first letter being \"א\" (Hebrew letter Aleph). The second word is \"abc\", and the third word is \"דהו\". As explained above, since the first character is in Hebrew (an RTL language) , the entire paragraph should be aligned to the right.\n\nWhen *composing* the message in k9, it renders correctly:\n![t1-compose-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206689673-3fb50c02-a2fa-4901-ba5e-e71710f4dff6.png)\nNote that the first word (אבג) is rightmost, followed (moving from right-to-left) by the second word (abc) and then the third (דהו). Also, the entire paragraph is aligned to the right.\n\nHowever, when *viewing* the received message in k9, it does not display correctly:\n![t1-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206691308-8267ae32-6978-4d24-bb0f-687384b19652.png)\nNot only is the entire text aligned to the left, but also the first word appears left-most, rather than right-most.\n\nThe received message is also rendered incorrectly when viewed in gmail:\n![t1-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206691954-737dc370-dc69-4e3e-b617-d73606a2afcd.png)\n\nOn the other hand, when trying the same test from Gmail, it displays correctly all along -- displays correctly while composing it in gmail:\n![t3-compose-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692209-9af61a72-3fb8-4f4b-a428-7a2b724619f0.png)\nrenders correctly after being received in gmail:\n![t3-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692276-a836479c-d78e-4890-a746-c6ee684d3467.png)\nand also renders correctly when viewed in k9:\n![t3-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692360-294572a6-ccef-4305-82a6-87359d1b869b.png)\n\nNote that both messages are composed in HTML/RTF format. However, when inspecting the messages, it can be seen that the one composed by gmail conatins html \"dir\" attributes (showing only the text/html part of the message):\n```\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=\"UTF-8\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<div dir=3D\"ltr\"><div dir=3D\"rtl\"><span class=3D\"gmail_default\" style=3D\"fo=\nnt-family:tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:small\">=D7=90=D7=91=D7=92 abc =D7=93=\n=D7=94=D7=95<br></span></div></div>\n```\nwhereas the one composed by k9 does not:\n```\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>=D7=90=D7=91=D7=92 abc =D7=93=D7=94=D7=95</body>=\n</html>\n```\n\nAs I started looking into whether this issue has already been reported, I came across a bunch of issues which seemingly *were* related -- especially #3391 and the associated PR #4841 -- however, although they are marked as fixed, clearly a problem still persists.\n\nSo continuing to investigate, I noticed that the above fix is applying the \"dir\" attribute to a `<pre>` element. So I tried the same tests with plaintext-formatted messages, with the following results: while composing the message in k9, all is good:\n![t2-compose-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695560-ca27c8bc-b2c0-43d2-82cf-4a186d3740a1.png)\nAnd now, also when viewing the received message in k9, it is rendered correctly!\n![t2-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695674-efcee0a8-d44f-41b4-bb56-8d9de01a5c0e.png)\nHowever, when viewed in gmail it still renders incorrectly:\n![t2-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695783-0da9b0f3-3f4b-485e-94f9-58911dbc536c.png)\n\nThe sent message is, truly, plaintext, so no formatting instructions can be applied to it. It is rendered correctly by k9 because the above-mentioned fix forces `<pre dir=\"auto\"...` onto the text while rendering. However, gmail (and, seemingly, most other mail clients) do not do that, and so it is rendered incorrectly by them. One can argue about which approach is more correct, but as long as most of the world is not yet using k9, it means that k9 users still have a problem communicating with non-k9 users...\n\nBTW, gmail approaches the issue differently (I'll spare the screenshots for this): when composing in plaintext mode it does not apply any bidi processing even during the composition -- and if the user tried to manually switch the text direction (the formatting UI in gmail allows that) it immediately switches to RTF format rather than plaintext.\n\n\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nThe solution, I *think*, is to surround outgoing HTML-formatted messages with a `<div dir=\"auto\"...` *as part of the sent content itself*.\n\nI realize that part of the problem here is that k9 doesn't yet provide a rich-formatting UI, so such formatting can't be applied explicitly by the user. But until such a time the above behavior would seem to be correct (and innocuous). And in fact, even once a formatting UI is provided, it probably would *still* be correct to automatically apply such a \"dir\" attribute, unless explicitly overridden by the explicit formatting.\n\nNot only would this solve the interoperability problem between k9 and non-k9 users, but, as observed, currently even within k9 itself, HTML-formatted message are rendered correctly while composing, but rendered *incorrectly* when viewed. The suggested fix would align the text as being rendered while composing with what would actually be viewed later on by k9 itself.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n_No response_",

The size of 2 wide by 4 tall is perfect to allow a rough but good overview of the mail inboxes while leaving enough space for further apps.\nIf k-9 would support a 2*4 widget I'd switch for good tbh.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\nIgnoring the wallpaper you can see 2*4 allows for essential apps to be easy to reach on the first page allowing it to be the perfect hub for everything necessary\nUsing the current 4*3 sized widget there'd be a lot space wasted and would make this efficient layout impossible.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18213041/194208817-7a2cdcc6-9cb0-4285-bce8-63b35162da05.jpg\" width=\"33%\">\n\nedit: reduced image display size\n",

You should put a checkbox in the K-9 Settings, unchecked by default: \"Allow self issued Verified Mark Certificate logos display\" which allows the displaying of self issued BIMI logos. If the checkbox is not marked, only authenticated VMC logos will be displayed. If the checkbox is marked, the \"a\" attribute (a=https://url.to/certificate.pem) is ignored and all BIMI logos will be displayed.\n\nIf BIMI record does not return a valid company logo:\n**Second option --> Clearbit API Service** - https://clearbit.com/logo - A free logo API service which allows you to quickly lookup company logos using just their domain. You need to credit them in the credits section of the Settings menu. I have seen this implemented in Spark email client and it works like a charm :)\n\nI think that a cascaded lookup of BIMI records and Clearbit API will populate most of the logos in the list view, providing users a more pleasant visual experience, and also a usability benefit.\n\nHope my suggestion helps :)\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40858521/192152962-14427640-8021-4fe2-803b-26853a936b7a.png)\n",

That creates clutter in the app.\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nAdd support for aliases by allowing adding a few email addresses for one account. It will synchronize only one (the main address). You can send an email from all your addresses.

    "body": "We're currently working on a new design for the message view. A (non-final) preview can be seen below.\n\n### Current state\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913295-709ad7d1-5f93-407a-a4b3-1fc2ae91f53c.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\n### Preview\n\n![Message header - HiFi - no download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913577-e27dd2f1-6b93-4a7b-a332-3cb3ada070f6.png)\n\n\nNotes on the image:\n- The chip containing \"Thunderbird Ryan\" is the name of the account the message belongs to. The chip is colored using the account color. It will only be displayed if there's more than one account.\n- The text below the chip is the subject of the message.\n- The circle-shaped image is the contact picture of the sender of the message.\n- The text at the top of the gray area, to the right of the contact picture is the name of the sender.\n- To the right we have a reply action and an overflow menu containing more actions.\n- Below the sender name there's information about the recipients. If the account only has one identity and the message was addressed to it, \"to me\" will be displayed. If the account has multiple identities the text that is shown will be \"to &lt;name of identity>\". If the message was addressed to someone else their display name will be shows. For now at most two recipient names will be displayed. If there's more recipients \"+x\" will be shown.\n- If a crypto provider is enabled for the account, an encryption indicator is displayed in front of the recipient text.\n- The \"Important, Todo, Work\" text is labels added to the message. This won't be relevant until #769 is implemented.\n- The \"show remote images\" button is not final and might move and/or change appearance.\n\nTapping any part of the gray area other than the action buttons on the right (reply, overflow menu), will open a bottom sheet containing details about the message.\n\n![Message header - Bottom Drawer HiFi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913663-8bb66aa2-3bbc-4b31-8479-21d770af4d73.png)\n\nIf there are a lot of recipients the bottom sheet can be dragged up to make it cover the whole screen. In that case we intend to provide a way to search/filter the recipient list.\n\n\n### Feedback\n\nWe're still working on the design. But if you're missing a feature or have other feedback, please let us know in a comment.\n\n---\n### Initial design considerations\n\nA message view redesign should include the following features:\n- #6180\n\nAnd it should keep in mind these features that we want to add further down the line:\n- #6181 \n   Email addresses need to be far enough apart so tapping them reliably is not a problem.\n- #1119 \n   We probably want to display the email address below the name and then hide the recipient addresses.\n- #769\n   Figure out where to display them.\n- #762 \n  Figure out where to display the folder name(s) (JMAP supports messages living in multiple folders).\n- #6197 \n  All of the per-message information/actions should live in the message header area, because at some point we'll want to display more than one message in this view. We need some touch area that collapses/expands the whole message.\n- #1397 \n  We need an overflow menu or some other place to put (less important) per-message actions like this.\n\nThis is what the message view looks like in other apps…\n\nGmail:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181325163-382d986e-24b6-450e-a48b-8802d9cc1c8b.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181325707-71db978e-5d33-4bd2-9deb-1b52509f2a03.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nOutlook:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181329504-6e21e461-87b6-4db2-a4dc-cdbde0c7d7a8.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181331199-cdc8b989-e39f-4a9b-af5f-9176f8bf0d3f.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nFairEmail:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181333692-a178adc5-f01c-480d-ba79-13e34e2bba21.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181334269-1cce6bc4-9079-46fe-b2d5-c210b9ea52f7.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nEDIT 2022-09-18: Updated with latest design.",

When I reply to an email it always changes to my default address (myname@mydomain.com). When I receive an email to servicename@mydomain.com I want to reply with the from address being servicename@mydomain.com, not myname@mydomain.com. I can edit the address manually, but sometimes I forget and I end up sending replies with myname@mydomain.com. servicename can be variable per email.\n\nCurrent problematic situation:\n\n1. Receive email incoming to servicename@mydomain.com\n2. Reply from address should be myname@mydomain.com\n\nNew wanted situation:\n\n1. Receive email incoming to servicename@mydomain.com\n2. Reply from address should be servicename@mydomain.com\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nFor reference, this option for example is built into thunderbird for a while now.\n\n![065RFJJ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5912061/172173607-938bf33f-7d2d-4341-8e0c-9a04a7be9bab.png)\n\n1. Go to Account Settings\n2. Enable Reply from this identity when delivery headers match\n3. Enter your domain prefixed by a wildcard (*), for example *@yourdomain.com\n4. Close/confirm all your changes\n5. Open an email that was sent to one of your catch-all addresses and click the reply button.\n6. The FROM field should be the catch-all address and not your general address.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n_No response_",

With the new GUI there are two possibilities for a startup screen:\n\n1. The side panel open, showing an unread cound of the **default** e-mail adress (this implies you have an address, that is more important than others).\n2. The inbox open, showing a unified inbox of all email accounts (that is heavily overloaded, if you have multiple highly used addresses).\n\nI miss badly an overview on startup with an unread & fav counter for each included email address like in the previous version (screen attached).\nFrom this screen I got an instant overview of the status of all accounts, without having to click you way through. By e.g. touching the _star icon_ you've been forwarded to a view with only the emails, marked as favourites (I used this crucial functionality like a todo list ;)\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI suppose the sidepanel being to small for this kind 'clickable' startup screen.

    "title": "\"Waiting for new emails\" notification should use low priority",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nFirst of all, congrats on the 5.800 release! It's clear it was a long road to get here, but it looks and works great.\n\nA family member is stuck on an older version of Android (7.1) and is finding the new push \"waiting for new emails\" notification annoying. It appears with normal priority (so it's interleaved with all of their other notifications) and it doesn't appear possible to disable it without disabling _all_ notifications for K-9 (which would sort of defeat the purpose of having push enabled in the first place).\n\nWe took a look at the documentation [for silencing or disabling the notification](https://forum.k9mail.app/t/how-to-configure-push/1102/1#notification-3), but these instructions don't appear to apply to Android 7.1 or below. Specifically, there doesn't appear to be a mechanism for granularly disabling or silencing specific kinds of notifications from an app -- it's all or nothing.\n\nThe notification on Android 7.1 looks like the one covered in the FAQ post:\n\n![ss1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258318-d837de77-3de0-4512-8afa-42c7799db649.png)\n\nHowever, long-pressing the notification reveals this menu instead of one that allows you to toggle individual notification types:\n\n![ss2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258559-73eed04e-d2aa-4df4-b8ce-ab36ffbdd3f9.png)\n\nThe \"More Settings\" option doesn't offer more granular configurability either:\n\n![ss3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258649-c56f75c3-8dc2-4105-8bca-ff51a6321314.png)\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nOther apps seem to solve this problem by using low-priority notifications. For example, when [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is running in an environment without Play Services, it'll spawn a persistent notification similar to K-9's. However, the notification doesn't have an icon that appears in the status bar -- you have to pull down the notification shade to see it at all -- and it appears at the very bottom of the notification list, in a slightly dimmed colour:\n\n![ss4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128259232-b5453345-f1cb-446c-9d81-668b58f33762.png)\n\nSignal _message_ notifications, of course, appear with normal priority.\n\nAbsent any way to hide specific kinds of notifications for a given app on older versions of Android, having K-9 do this seems like it would be the best and least obtrusive solution.\n\nIn case it helps, I took a quick look in Signal's code -- [this appears to be the method and parameter in question](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/1a56924a56a191a1271ba70b2e12a3af3ad289bc/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/messages/IncomingMessageObserver.java#L275), using `androidx.core.app.NotificationCompat.Builder`. The [docs for the method](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setPriority(int)) explain:\n\n> On platforms `Build.VERSION_CODES.O` and above this value is ignored in favor of the importance value set on the notification's channel. **On older platforms, this value is still used, so it is still required for apps supporting those platforms.**\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nThe family member could disable push and enable polling instead. (This is slightly annoying, since push/IDLE seemed to work fine on previous versions of K-9 without the notification, with battery optimizations disabled. My understanding is that the notification is necessary specifically for new versions of Android, which is fair enough.)\n\nOr they could roll back to an older version of K-9. This would definitely be a shame -- and probably not ideal long-term for security and maintenance -- but would fix the notification annoyance.\n",

    "title": "Move account selection icons to the bottom",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nI have installed the latest release of k9 to test the new interface. It looks modern and nice. Yet, I already have pain in my right hand from switching accounts. I have a phone with a 6.5\" screen and switching accounts is very difficult. I have to stretch my thumb all the way to the top left corner, a very uncomfortable motion.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be great if the icons were moved (optionally?) to the bottom of the drawer (the thing that slides in from the left side of the screen). This does not have to be sth super slick and intelligent, just a new row with the account icons in series one by one. If you have more that the row can show, it would just be scrollable. This would also solve the issue that when more than 3 accounts are in place, using the account icons at the top of the drawer is unintuitive and only cycle among 3 accounts only.\n\nThe top space of the drawer would show what is still does, but the account **selection** buttons (not the bigger one that shows the active account) could be replaced with account, folder and general setting buttons. This way the \"Settings\" option would be moved from the bottom to the top as a non-frequently used option (I would argue that users don't visit the settings more than they switch accounts).\n\nHere is a rough example:\n\n![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11805218/98535591-aab6c980-2286-11eb-9ed7-7b277e17338d.jpg)\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nI tried using either the account icons or the drop down list, but they are both at the left top corner. I also tried using the unified inbox, but I turned it off. It also wouldn't solve the issue of switching accounts for other things other than reading the inbox.",

I tried to stick as close to the old design as possible in terms of structure and layout to keep the apps branding recognizable.  It's the first concept I've done so there may be some stuff that's a off a little ; )\n\n![concept_inbox_and_email_mobile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22890589/22260218/aef666e8-e268-11e6-8824-52f3be1933e8.png)\n\n**Inbox:**\nThis Screen is very similar to the old implementation just alingned with with Material Design metrics and some adjusted colors. Also the unread count moved down from the toolbar to make space for actions like search and sort as well as compact account and expunge in the overflow menu. The e-mails are now grouped by date so it's easier to quickly find the one you're looking for (only \"today\" and \"yesterday\"). Also the compose action is  now a FAB in the bottom right corner.\n\n**E-Mail**\nThe email screen itself is like an extra layer ontop of the resting UI. Ist fairly minimal to leave room for  attachments  and quoted text. You can still archive, delete mark as read/unread and share with the Actions now in the toolbar. The two main actions reply and forward are located at the bottom for \nmaximum visibility (and can be expanded with a reply all option).\n\n![concept_compose_and_nav_drawer_mobile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22890589/22267155/ffc1f64a-e282-11e6-89fb-87e299acb749.png)\n\n**Compose**\nComposing an e-mail is more straight forward than before thanks to the use of full bleed text fields and contact chips. Also multiple attachments can stack to save space.\n\n**Navigation Drawer**\nIn the nav drawer you can directly switch between accounts and view the unified inbox, this saves the user a couple of taps. The expandable menu also makes it possible to add and remove accounts. Also adding the settings to the bottom unclutters other menus.\n\n![color_palette](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22890589/21393046/05143fe6-c793-11e6-9b00-460096a79da2.png)\n\n**Color**\nThe rather blank light/dark color palette is supposed to keep the attention on the content instead of distracting the user (e.g. with a bright green toolbar). The primary high contrast accent color is used only in places that are important to the current state of the UI. The secondary a bit toned down accent color highlights elements without being to dominant. \n\nI'd really like to hear some feedback and could also do a dark/tablet version of these concepts, redesign other areas of the app or design some smaller more specific features (only if there's even interest).\n\nIf you want to look up some metrics or just play around with the source files, they're based on a 360*640 screen with xxhdpi density so 1px equals 1dp (updated everytime I add new stuff): [concepts.zip](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/files/727550/concepts.zip)",

For example you want to forward somebody the sender's e-mail address (\"Can you send me the address of ...?\") or create a new (clean) mail to the guy with the CC address.\n\nIt would be great, to be able to open a small menu after a long-press on an e-mail address. The menu should contain the items: 1. \"Add to contacts\" (or \"Open contact\" when already added to contacts), 2. \"Copy to clipobard\", 3. \"Start new e-mail\" (to this address). This behaviour is known for example from the AOSP contact app. A long-press on an address asks you to copy to clipboard, too.\n\nThere is workaround I use, but it is rather complicated: options menu of an e-mail, \"Show headers\" and then you can copy parts of the mail header like normal text.\n\nSincerely\nSpectas\n\nPS: I played a bit with Gimp to show a bit, how this could look like:\n![k9-screenshot3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3306424/14177844/8015d30a-f758-11e5-9fde-842b833f839f.png)\n",

Create a new email account by clicking the \"Plus\" button.\n2. Enter your email address and your password. Then abort the wizard _before_ anywhere before getting to the last page (where you're asked for the account name) by pressing back.\n3. You return to app's \"Accounts\" screen. The account has been created (though not completely configured)\n4. Delete it by touching it for two seconds and selecting \"Remove account\" from the menu displayed.\n5. You should see the confirmation dialogue as shown in the attached screenshot.\n\nIt seems the cause of this is because the account name string is not properly initialized until the last page of the account creation wizard shows up. That should be easy to fix ;)\n\nKeep up your great work, I really enjoy that application! :)\nRegards - Lucas\n\nScreenshot:\n![screenshot_2015-12-01-22-41-44](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5623987/11515230/20922b5c-987d-11e5-85f4-25bfd818f4f9.png)\n",

    "body": "So @cketti found the awesome concept for a K-9 rework using Material Design by @juliakorbut at http://julia.io/works/k-9/index.html\n![](http://julia.io/works/k-9/images/k9_01.png)\n(Only one of the screens, see the [website](http://julia.io/works/k-9/index.html) for everything.)\n\nExcept for a few things this is a great analysis and design. @juliakorbut would be great if you could chime in since you are the original author! :)\n- (from @cketti) We should not be using tabs for the main folders because it would clash with using swipe for displaying the actions https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/623 – the folders are good in the sidebar as shown in a later screen\n- On the second screen, the actions are both on top and on the bottom – that’s a bit strange. They should only be in one place.\n- The the actions on the bottom take up a lot of space on the bottom – We can just put the »New message« button in the header, next to the search icon.\n- (from @cketti) I kind of like how the Gmail app puts the 'reply', 'reply all' and 'forward' actions at the end of the message. For that to be useful, we need to collapse the quoted text by default, though.\n- On the compose screen, the »Sign« and »Encrypt« takes up a lot of vertical space. Maybe we should put it on the right of the subject field line as a lock icon, with a dropdown exposing these options? Otherwise the textarea is barely visible (as seen in the screenshot)\n\n@juliakorbut @cketti what do you think?\n\ncc @AMDG2 because you’re working on the Material Design rework https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/599. And @vt0r who was involved in the discussion.\n\nLet’s make this real! :rocket: :)\n",
