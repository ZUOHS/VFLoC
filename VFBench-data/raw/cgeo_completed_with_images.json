    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nWhile working on a ticket and creating PR #15768 I realized that Google Maps offers a wide range of very detailled styling options, including visibility and coloring for all sorts of elements on the map. Details can be found eg via Google's Map Style editor at https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/:\n\n![image](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/assets/6909759/240d2d87-ebfc-4214-87c9-14ad78aeff40)\n![image](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/assets/6909759/3d447af8-1e9f-49e4-8a0f-bd00165984c2)\n\nThere are also some predefined themes available, which howeber seems to be just preconfigured using the same advanced option set.\n\nAs of today c:geo offers for GM a bunch of \"Themes\" which are technically just complete configuration sets out of the vast options available. Those are Default, NIght, Retro and High Contrast. Probably those were copied at the time from the then-available preconfigured themes? PR #15768 adds a new theme \"Details\" to this set.\n\nIt might be worth discussing whether we want to transport more detailled GM config options into c:geo, as we already do for OSM maps in Theme options.\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nOne suggestion would be to allow \"theme options\" for GM as we do for OSM to turn features of the map \"on\" or \"off\". OPtions would be e.g. \"Attractions\", \"Business\" etc. In contrast to OSM we would have to offer a three-way-select (visibility \"on\", \"Off\" or \"inherit from theme\"). Also we would have to respect the hierarchy of GM (e.g. an option \"Point of interest\" sets visibility for all POIs while \"Business\" may override this with another visibility setting for Business-POIs)\n\nWe could also allow to set different colors, fills and such for different elements, but this would go too far IMHO. Up to discussion of course\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nNot to do anything\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

There are certainly multiple ways to do this; one nice way could be to use the labels of the x-axis as in my mockup drawing.\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nWhile working on support ticket 841995 I noticed a potentially confusing behavior of c:geo.\n\nWhen logging a gc.com cache, c:geo offers to send actions for trackables in inventory (one of do nothing, visited or dropped off):\n![image](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/assets/6909759/40eed246-ef6d-486c-a0d1-a9250c5d74c9)\n\nUsers often have different \"default actions\" they want to have associated with trackables in their inventory. For example, some should log a \"visited\" on every found cache, others should maybe not get logged (\"do nothing\"). To ease log creation, c:geo stores the last used action on a per-trackable-basis and pre-fills log screen with this action.\n\nc:geo stores a new \"default action\" on a trackable every time a log is sent to gc.com server (not when it is just saved locally offline). This can lead to following confusing scenario:\n\n* User creates a log, He changes the default-action-to-far \"visible\" to \"do nothing\" for an inventory tb while do so. He saves the log (not sending it)\n* User creates a new log for another cache. --> now in this log the default action is again filled with \"visible\" (because previous log was not yet send). This is potentially confusing\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nUpdate inventory-tb-default-action on log-save (not on log-send)\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\ndo nothing\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI want to put this up for discussion",

E.g. the image \"Fischerprüfung\" is also shown in the listing:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168005616-7c42bcbe-d68c-4e6d-ad73-a28ae07290b2.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168005708-6635b9cc-aea5-4d19-a668-967093076786.png)\n\nIn HTML source the two URLs used are only slightly different (attachment references \"large\" version of image, embedded image does not):\n* Image embedded in listing: `<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/18a9e1fc-9d5b-4089-91b3-ffb28699c702.jpg\" width=\"500px\" />`\n* Image as attachment:  `<a href=\"https://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/18a9e1fc-9d5b-4089-91b3-ffb28699c702.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\">Fischerprüfung</a>`\n\nIn c:geo image gallery the image is displayed two times:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168006507-9d766572-531b-4e3d-a7e3-4e970aa3e6b7.png)\n\nAs of today, the GCConnector does not differentiate between the two, both are delivered as images to c:geo core. THe information whether the image is an attachment or from listing is not passed.\n\n**Solution possibilities**\n\nWhat we could do:\n* We could introduce a new image category LISTING_ATTACHMENT and make the connector(s) differentiate between the two\n* For spoiler view we could filter out displayed images by ignoring the \"large\" in URL comparison\n* We could in general (not only for spoiler images) filter out duplicate images in image gallery this way...\n\n_Originally posted by @eddiemuc in https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/12938#issuecomment-1124582668_",

Therefore, I have written a script which increases fonts, lines and symbols by a configurable factor, which massively increases usability.\n\nThe other day I learned two things:\n1. I am not the only one with this \"problem\". \n2. Locus has a setting for this, in fact, to increase all map elements by a configurable factor ...\n\n... what gave me the idea that c:geo could perhaps offer this functionality, too.  ;)\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nFrom my experience, it turned out to be best to have three factors:\n\n1. Font Size\n2. Line Width\n3. Symbol Size\n\n... as in fact I like the theme best, if fonts are increased to 160, lines to 120 and symbols to 130 percent,\nwhile my teammate prefers F140/L120/S110 and a friend of ours even wanted to have F180/L120/S130.\nAlthough my script can create all three in one go, life would be way easier, if c:geo would support to do this itself.  ;)\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nJust write yourself a script to increase sizes ...  ;)\n\n### Additional Information\n\nAs an example here a comparison between original (in fact close to unreadable) vs. \"my\" F160, L120 S130:\n\n![Current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889015/166129743-99b5491b-2d88-42ca-9475-952389318942.jpg) ![Font 160 Lines 120 Symbols 130](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9889015/166129750-7206c548-d96b-436b-b068-17b710c58b58.jpg)\n\n",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nIn \"Add waypoint\" dialog there's a button to insert \"my location\" which uses Location Provider to get the device location.\nDue to the nature of Location Provider this info will be more or less accurate, e.g. before opening the dialog only coarse location is used, then when opening it it switches to precise location but that takes some time to get a lock. So opening the dialog and repeatedly pressing the button will give you different results - usually getting more precise.\n\nMost users will not be aware of this fact and just open the dialog, click on \"my location\" and exit it again, resulting in an inaccurate location.\n\nTo raise awareness of the quality/reliability of this information we should display the accuracy somewhere in the dialog. This would enable users to wait until they get a lock that's \"good enough\" for them.\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nAdd the location accuracy to the \"my location\" button and update it regulary (ideally event-based if Location Provider has that ability, otherwise time-based). We can probably check the map accuracy circle for the best way of doing that.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1258173/165147488-06179e37-d0f1-40b0-b485-a433a72f278b.png)\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

A couple of things stood out as a bit jarring though: mostly the glowing location indicator. \n\n![2022-03-24-010700](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159870505-a23f9949-7e0d-4d62-8c44-5cf304962b77.png) (c:geo's location icon)\n\nIt's a very skeuomorphic design and reminds me strongly of Google Maps on the iPhone 3. Not that that's bad on its own! I sometimes miss the old gem-like interfaces that used to be everywhere. But it doesn't fit very well with the rest of the app being material design.\n\n![2022-03-24-011446](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159871858-c8560aef-e0a6-42e0-ad01-eee24e133b8d.png) (location indicator on the iPhone 3)\n\nI also think the quick settings menu could possibly be moved up to the top bar (plus, it has a lot of overlapping functionality with the filter menu), and the zoom in / out buttons might look better round, but those are probably separate issues.\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nSomething flatter and less glowey would fit better. \n\nThis is what Google Maps currently uses: \n![2022-03-24-011749](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159872485-a9dad6b4-4528-4f8f-ac6d-acac46e69ed7.png)\n\nI think that knowing the precise location you're pointing is important enough when geocaching that the location indicator should still be an arrow for clarity.\n\nSomething like this might work well: \n![2022-03-24-012031](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159872822-c910ee43-5413-41fd-9f36-1504c2ef512f.png) \n![2022-03-24-012112](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159873219-5bc68de2-43c7-4f11-8153-b1d13e1f6bf9.png)\n\nOr keeping the original arrow shape: \n![2022-03-24-012423](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159873493-ef18ed7f-93ae-4d4a-9130-649fa658742c.png)\n\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

MAybe same icon?\n* Remove the stuff completely (don't mark calculated waypoints)? \n* Totally different idea(s)?\n\nI would love to get feedback on this.

This should be changed to opening the waypoint-action-selection list (see screenshot). This list is opened today when long-tapping a waypoint.\n* When long-tapping the waypoint it should be drag&droppable to another list position. Comparable to e.g. the image list in offline log entries or the caches/waypoints in the individual route list.\n\nAdditional positive effect is that all the different waypoint actions become much easier accessible because they do no longer require a long-tap for initiation.\nDownside of this is that the action \"edit waypoint\" is now slightly less accessible (requires two taps instead of one), but I never understood wh this action is considered \"more important\" than all the others anyway.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/142737733-60f638cf-29f6-4b48-99bb-4154c1f67e76.png)\n\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nadd decicated icon action buttons for \"drag/drop\" (hamburger icon) to the waypoint line, a bit like im log image list or individual route list.

Currently it's more or less an unsorted bunch of links (no offense intended! I do know where all those links come from...). For a basic member, it looks like this:\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/137530656-aeebe4f3-85d7-41c8-b780-437a1a9ac4c9.png)\n\nAnd a gc.com PM even has two more entries (bookmarks / pocket queries). Depending on screen length and font sizes, you'll even have to scroll...\n\nI have no ready-at-hand idea how to do this, so I'd like to start a gathering of ideas how to enhance and structure this page.\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nA starting point could be to transfer two or three easily recognizable and frequently used links to icons in the toolbar, e. g.\n- Settings\n- About c:geo\n\nThis should be easy to realize and cause no harm, but will reduce the list by two entries already.\n(If we agree on implementing #11897, this would be the third icon on this toolbar.)\n\nNext I thought of some grouping of the remaining ten entries, but alas they are nearly as much diverse as possible :-) - Have not found a helpful grouping for the entries yet.\n\nAnother idea could be to change the textual entries into a two-column layout of large graphical buttons (+ text), but this would solve neither the grouping problem nor the possibility of having to scroll.\n\nAny ideas whether we can leave-out some of those entries? \nWe had some discussion about the \"scan geocode\" feature lately, but haven't decide to remove it for now. \n\"Useful apps\" could become a separate tab on the \"about c:geo\" screen (as we have other useful links regarding c:geo over there already), which would simply transfer the problem to a different, but less-crowded, place.\n\nAlso we should discuss the order in which the entries are shown. IMHO the most important entries should stay at the top (as they mostly do, currently only \"report problem\" seems to me being too important for staying at the end of the list).\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nhopefully plenty :-)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

I have multiple ideas how to improve this workflow:\n\n- [ ] Make keyboard popping up automatically (for all text input dialogs in cgeo)\n- [ ] Instead of allowing \"can be left empty\" for variable names, add a dedicated top-level button for it\n- [ ] Remove \"A-E\" button, as it IMHO has no benefit. No one will ever need exactly 5 variables. (Without being a gamer, I have a click speed of ~6 clicks per second, so the suggested top-level button should do the same job. Simply click it 5x, which still takes less time than opening the \"create variable\"-dialog once.)\n- [ ] Automatically focus the value field and open keyboard after a variable is created\n\n---\nJust for reference - These are the steps which are required to create a new waypoint currently:\n\n1.

    "title": "Extend support for calculated variables in cache",
    "body": "Last days I thought about how we can add better support for calculated values into c:geo especially for mysteries and multis. We already have the waypoint calculator but it has a few drawbacks:\n* it can only calculate waypoints from variables. However I often have to calculate other things as well esp numbers to open locks, checksums and such\n* It does not allow for usage of e.g. formulas. For example I often need to calculate Buchstabenwortwerte (what's the English word for it?) or checksums and have to leave c:geo for it\n* It is somewhat deeply buried into the waypoint details which makes it difficult to use.\n\nTherefore I propose the introduction of a new cache tab \"Variables\" which allows for adding variables and put a formula on them. Here's a sketch on how this may look:\n\n![IMG_20210823_133035__01.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/130441186-ff781d32-f046-48ba-88f3-f881a6663876.jpg)\n\nAdditional ideas:\n* Variables created here could be used in waypoint calculator of course\n* A scan could be implemented trying to parse formulas/variables from listing and adding them here. Might be a heuristic approach where user can decide whether a result is correct or not before it is added. (A 100% correct scan is probably impossible to implement)\n* Functions available for usage in formulas must be discussed. Whatever set is chosen it can easily be extended later.\n\nIdea is also to make the entries editable directly (no \"open\" step necessary) to ease their usage in the field.\n\nSome more details, probably not so important right now:\n* No strong typing of variables. Current idea is to support text and int as values in the variables. If something looks like an int it is interpreted as such, otherwise as text. Is float support necessary?\n* Variable names are Case-sensitive and start with a letter. Can be composed of letters and digits otherwise\n* In a formula, every letter-block is interpreted as a constant text, except if a variable of same name exists (then it is interpreted as the variable of course). Optionally text can be enclosed by \" or '\n\nWhat do you think?",

Will this be treated as \"not present\"? \n\nAnd for my use-case I should use only \"has offline log\" in the status filter?\n\nOr is that the expected behaviour - means \"description is (not) present\"?\nBut then - with the changes of #11430 - there is no possibility to filter for empty e.g. \"didn't find\", correct?",

Load a saved configuration, create and adopt the sub-filter, etc, etc...\n\nI guess this would be the cleanest and feature richest solution, where most code parts AFAIK even could be reused without much effort.\n\nThere are very legit use cases for it: e.g. I want to display only traditionals OR caches which are contained in a specific list but what to hide all found ones. A filter which is currently not possible to build.\n\nWe could give users with the \"sub-filter\" filter the same possibilities as with the actionbar icon in maps viewer. Short click -> open filter screen | Long click -> stored filter selection.\n\nFeature should go to `master` \n\n_Originally posted by @fm-sys in https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/10581#issuecomment-882854827_ ff.

    "body": "While working on new filter framework I discovered a potential problem:\n\nc:geo offers currently a lot of \"Search by\" functions in the search activity. Those were clearly originally copied from the old/legacy gc.com-search here: https://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx\n\nAmong them is the search function \"Found by\" (Gefunden von):\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/124426473-5fe44780-dd6a-11eb-9ed0-834c60f510fd.png)\n\nNow the problem: \n* this kind of search is not supported by the new filter framework for geocaching.com\n* It **can't** be supported by the new framework because the web proxy search interface used does not offer the possibility to search by \"Found by\" (it supports only search by \"not found by\")\n\nSince gc.com is our \"major service\" I see two possible solutions out of this\n* Remove \"Found by\" search function from c:geo. As said before this was clearly only introduced anyway because it was once available on (now legacy) gc.com search, and it is no longer available to the users via \"normal\" website\n* Leave legacy search for this specific function. However, new filter framework can NOT be used in interconnection\n\nI am strongly suggest the first solution (remove search function). What is your opinion?\n",

The old look, having same height, was a very straight-forward, clean look, visually stable. But giving the \"more details\" button the same height as our new icon buttons makes it clumsy and way too big.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/124348914-f7239080-dbec-11eb-9788-92c31f66bc1f.png)\n(to the left: new style and two \"old\" buttons for comparison / to the right: old style)\n\n## Suggested solution\n- decrease the icon button size to the same dimensions as the old icon buttons had\n- increase the size of the \"inner image\" to mostly fill the (decreased) dimensions\n- adjust \"more details\" (and any other default button) to have (at least) the same height as the icon buttons\n\n## Alternatives/workarounds\n- make \"more details\" button full width\n- find a different placement for the \"hint\" icon button, maybe by placing \"refresh\" and \"delete\" on the same line, and placing \"edit list\" and \"hint\" on the second\n\nBut that would solve only the third issue.",

Nothing or something like \"Cache info\" (if it fits in all languages)?\n- It also looks strange, that the height of \"More Details\" (outline) is more narrow than the outline of the icon next to it.\n\nOther thought:\nWould a bottom sheet maybe suitable to replace it completely?\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/949669/123547222-37ec5700-d760-11eb-8280-58af09e0e4f2.png)\n\nAfter clicking on a cache it could show its name only (one liner as in the example above) and the user can expand it to view the other details...

    "body": "There are many geocache series out there that use the following name schema:\n```\nA very very very long description prefix #1\nA very very very long description prefix #2\n...\n```\n**When clicking a cache on the map in cgeo only the first part of the name is displayed - often not containing the important information at the end.**\nIt would be nice to immediately see the full name without having to additionally clicking on details. If there is no cell phone reception, showing the details might not even work! Rotating the screen is a workaround, but very annoying and the name might be still too long.\nIMHO smartphone displays should be large enough nowadays to show the full name.\nMaybe make it multi line text and/or adjust the text size.\n\nExample ([GC97DZB](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC97DZB)):\nThe full cache name/number `Traumrunde Prichsenstadt #04` is only visible after rotating the device.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16803864/119869021-10675c00-bf20-11eb-9d06-7163a0a644a8.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16803864/119870648-e2831700-bf21-11eb-81c6-c670f05c8e4e.jpg\" height=\"300\">",

    "body": "## Strongly linked to the [Filtering / searching project](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/projects/16):\n\nThe GC live map provides a bunch of filter options, which would allow \"live filtering\" without the need of using the \"Show as list\" workaround which is ugly and doesn't allow filtering by attributes if caches are not downloaded. Even basic members could filter for multiple cache types, premium members even for size, attributes, etc.\n\n@cgeo/team Is someone interested in tackling this issue? We have a bunch of issues open, which are dealing with filtering in general. Of course, at the moment SAF has priority, but as soon as it is done, we could start with refactoring all c:geo filter functionalities, so they are easier to use and understand. \n\nIt would be an important step for a redesign (#10003), probably even the biggest weak point in our current UI. However, I think we need to tackle this issue together as it's probably difficult to handle for a single person...\n\n\n\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64581222/108070357-b889a100-7064-11eb-863e-79995adc7550.png)\n",

    "title": "make onboarding with offline maps easier for new users of c:geo",
    "body": "One of the steepest hurdles for new users of c:geo is installing an offline map, IMHO. Thus probably most new users (except technically very savant) stick to Google maps and miss one of the greatest features of c:geo - offline caching.\n\nThere have been proposals for downloading maps in the past (eg #6072, #7529), but they are very sophisticated approaches which try to automate everything and cover a wide range of use cases. Sadly, they are also a bit more heavy to implement, not only on our side but on providers' side as well, and nobody has done it yet.\n\nI propose a more basic approach with the focus on simplifying onboarding for new users of c:geo:\n- Skip themeing, only support downloading map files for this onboarding feature. Therefore use a map source which does not need a separate theme file. (This would be the hs-esslingen mirror of download.mapsforge.org)\n- Direct the user to the relevant directory, let them download the map file using the browser, and make c:geo integrate the downloaded file...\n- ... which would include copying the file to c:geo map directory, set the map provider and current map file accordingly.\n\nImplementation wise there are three areas of work:\n- [x] Offer a link to the map download site\n- [x] Recognize downloaded map files and move them to c:geo maps dir (current map dir, if already set, or new default one)\n- [x] Set map handler and current map file accordingly\n\nI've started working on it. Current state is:\n\na) Initiate download via Settings => Map => Download basic offline maps:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78711262-fbdc9480-7916-11ea-8c0c-d571932ed6f6.png)\n\nb) Info screen:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78711297-0a2ab080-7917-11ea-93c9-fc4f9bb403d9.png)\n\nc) Detecting that a map already exists under the same file name:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/79076617-c90e1400-7cfb-11ea-8337-44032687df2a.png)\n\nd) cancellable progress dialog during transfer:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/79076626-e642e280-7cfb-11ea-8df3-d7f4233deaa7.png)\n\n\ne) confirmation dialog after successful installation:\n(recognition of file name depends on Android version and map source; may be a more generic name like \"5.map\" or \"msf:27.map\")\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78916095-41bb6900-7a8d-11ea-8539-4db4a0731a2f.png)\n\nAlternatively you can tap on a map file stored locally. This would enter the process shown above at step c).\n\nThis is work in progress. May be ready featurewise, but needs more testing with other file types (locally and online) as well as under more Android versions.",

    "title": "Implement \"Result Highlighting\" in the Calculator.",
    "body": "As mentioned in #6716 (Managing ambiguous results in WP Calc where trailing/leading zeros are involved) it can be necessary to insert additional zeros into the result of a formulation, and in some instances there is contention as to whether these should be 'leading-zeros' or 'trailing-zeros'.  It has been suggested that a method of identifying how a result has been manipulated would be desirable and a suggestion made is to colour the 'manipulated' digits differently to provide this indication:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6573522/32086853-90e4e82e-bb1f-11e7-95aa-de13c587272f.png)\n\nDeveloper notes:\n>Implementing this is not as trivial as one might at first think for a few reasons:\n>\n>The main concern is that the text to display for a valid location is actually obtained from the waypoint itself rather than from the input strings used to create it.  This is done specifically so that users can be aware of exactly what the resulting waypoint will actually represent rather than their entered value (which may result in something they did not expect).  Although we have access to both the input string and the resulting GeoPoint's string displaying a 'diff' of these two strings is not as trivial as you may think.\n>\n>However, once it is known what colours should be used for each letter actually displaying the desired results shouldn't be too hard given TextView's support the use of HTML strings.\n\nFurther notes:\n>Once implemented this \"Syntax Highlighting\" would be most useful in conveying information to users of what leads to \"Parsing Failures\" (as related to #6802: Coordinate Parser Needs Work).",

    "title": "Feature Request: Add organizational \"pins\" for stored lists",
    "body": "##### Feature Request:\n\nOne feature I would like to see would be improved organizational tools within C:Geo. My suggestion would be to add the ability to assign a pin to a stored list so that on the main map, one would see that pin color on the associated geocache. \n##### Why is this needed?\n\nMy current area map is completely littered with the pencil \"note\" icon, though the notes are different for each cache. The closest post I could find for this problem was #5037 which outlined the desire for icons for many different situations. Some examples are caches that you need certain tools to complete, night caches, caches that are appropriate to take certain people in your life to, etc...\n##### Implementation:\n\nThe user would first have to create a stored list independently. From the list view you could tap the upper right drop down menu (the 3 vertical dots), then tap the (new) option \"Assign pin.\" Once that is tapped a box with 5 different colored swatches would appear. One would then tap the desired color. That pin would then appear next to the stored list name wherever the name appears. Once a pin is assigned to a stored list, the entry in the upper right drop down menu would then say \"Unassign pin\" or something similar instead. \n##### Possible Issues and Solutions:\n\nSome of the concerns raised with #5037 were:\n- More icons may make it more difficult for new users.\n  - With the implementation suggested, there would be none visible on the map for a new user. It would need to be self initiated by knowing both how to create a stored list, and how to assign a pin. Therefore one could consider this an advanced feature. \n- More icons would cause \"over-crowding\" of the live map\n  - Stored lists without an assigned pin would still appear with the floppy disc icon on the main map. \n  - This wouldn't add additional \"noise\" to the baseline green ring, it would simply replace information already available with increased specificity for each user.  \n- Multiple new icons on the map would be \"too much.\" (I interpenetrated as too many icons as it was suggested to have icons such as tools, locks, etc for different circumstances.) \n  - This approach limits a large variety of possible icons by giving users a limited few that they can use however they see fit. \n  - This simplicity of the pin icon in various colors is also easy on the eye. \n  - This implementation is essentially \"opt-in\" only. \n##### Other comments and remarks:\n\nThanks to all the capable people who make this great piece of software. I use it almost everyday. \n\nHere is a quick mock-up of what one's map may look like with the pin's from multiple stored lists.\n\n![screenshot_2016-06-19-07-38-49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20041945/16190800/fe179f3c-3695-11e6-82de-fb0c45fa2030.jpeg)\n",

    "title": "Implement 'needs maintenance' for Opencaching",
    "body": "All Opencaching sites now support 'needs maintenance' logs. Opencaching.de additionally has the feature of a 'needs maintenance' cache state (similar to the GC attribute 42) and of logging 'cache is ok' (does not need maintenance) by any user. All this is available through OKAPI, and it would be nice if it was added to c:geo.\n\nFirst the basics. There are two different paradigms on 'needs maintenance' logs:\n1. The GC way, which uses a dedicated log type \"Needs maintenance\" and is implemented also on OCPL sites (all OC sites except OC.de) and in c:geo.\n2. The OC.de way, which uses a 'needs maintenance' = true / false / not-specified flag, which can be combined with any log type. This is also the way it is implemented in OKAPI, even when submitting logs to OCPL sites; OKAPI then will translate the logs to OCPL/GC logic.\n\nI think the easiest way to implement submitting and displaying OC 'needs maintenance' in c:geo may be this:\n\n**Submit 'needs maintenance'**\n\nEnable log type 'Needs maintenance' for OC, and translate it to `logtype=Comment&needs_maintenance2=true` in the OKAPI request.\n\n**Displaying 'needs maintenance' logs**\n- Besides of the log type, also query the field `needs_maintenance2`.\n- For logs which are not of type \"Needs maintenance\" (this is returned only by OCPL sites) and have `needs_maintenance2` = `true`, display an additional needs-maintenance-symbol besides of the log type symbol.\n- For any log with `needs_maintenance2` = `false`, display a symbol for \"cache is ok\" or \"cache does not need maintenance\" besides of the log type symbol. This is the symbol displayed at OC.de: ![cache is ok](https://www.opencaching.de/resource2/ocstyle/images/log/16x16-needs-maintenance-no.png) This may be omitted for \"Ready for search\" logs, which imply that the cache is ok and always have `needs_maintenance2` = `false` at OC.de.\n\n**Displaying the 'needs maintenance' cache state**\n- Request the field `needs_maintenance`, and handle the value `true` like the GC attribute 42.\n\n**Lose ends**\n\nWhat is still missing now is submitting \"cache is ok\" (which is only supported by OC.de, other OC sites will ignore it and return the (localized) message: _Your cache log entry was posted successfully. However, your \"does not need maintenance\" flag was ignored, because Opencaching.XX does not yet support this feature._)\n\nThis would need a change through the whole log-submitting logic of c:geo, either adding an OC-only log type \"cache is ok\" which will be translated to OKAPI `logtype=Comment&needs_maintenance2=false`, or adding an additional input field for the geocache's maintenance state.\n\n@rsudev \nWe have already bin in talk about this issue; maybe you already prepared an implementation for the first step - submit OC 'needs maintenance'?\n",

Look at the waypoints, the order is different from the website. It looks like that reference points are displayed first. But in this case the reference point is a kind of \"walked by\"/via point, the waypoints should be kept in the website order.\n\nMaybe its not a bug but a change request (in case its intended to have a different order than the website), cannot determine that. \n\nc:geo:2014.5.14 Android:4.2.2 samsung:S3mini\n",

    "title": "Feature Request - Colour Code Lists/Caches",
    "body": "I keep many lists to separate out caches into groups. Examples include Church Micros (a very popular series in the UK), specific D/T ratings, date hidden, interesting caches, night caches, etc. When out and about, I use the 'enable live' feature to display these on the map, however, once the map becomes populated, it is very difficult to distinguish the location of these 'special'  caches amongst all the others.\n(Note, I also have lists for letterboxes and virtuals, which are easier to see due to the distinctive icons).\n\nMy proposal is to be able to apply colour codes to either complete lists or individual caches in order to highlight them as priority targets.\n\nThe c:geo icon for a cache has a border of white around it (grey for a disabled or archived cache). The intention is to be able to change this border - only a small number of primary colours would be needed. See mock-up on the attched image.\n\n![2014-01-07 13 23 26](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1512344/1859231/14696af8-779f-11e3-811f-2709768870d6.png)\n",
