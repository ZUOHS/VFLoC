    "body": "### What feature or improvement do you think would benefit Files?\n\nI'm currently experiencing a usability issue with the context menu in the software.\n\nThe right-click context menu cannot be configured to use the Windows 10 single-level style with the Windows 11 visual appearance. Instead, it always follows the default Windows 11 behavior: displaying shortcut icons at the top and using nested submenus. The submenus load slowly — after right-clicking, it shows \"Loading...\" and takes 1–2 seconds before the submenu items appear.\n\nThere is no option in the software settings to switch to a single-level context menu. I’ve managed to achieve this behavior in the default Windows 11 File Explorer by installing a plugin, which provides the Windows 10-style context menu with improved speed and accessibility. However, in the Files software, the plugin doesn't work, and there’s no built-in way to configure how the context menu is displayed — only which items are shown.\n\nThis significantly reduces efficiency, as the current two-level, slow-loading menu introduces delays during file operations.\n\nWould it be possible to add support for:\n\nSwitching to a single-level context menu (Windows 10 style)\n\nDisabling top shortcut icons and nested menus\n\nImproving submenu loading speed\n\nAllowing third-party plugins to modify the context menu behavior\n\nAimed performance is following:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da57d026-e45e-495b-a6e0-f8f9b2121ec5)\n\n### Requirements\n\n- This proposal will accomplish X\n- This proposal will accomplish Y\n- This proposal will accomplish Z\n\n\n### Files Version\n\n3.9.0.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n26100.4061\n\n### Comments\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "I'm not sure if a lot of users would find this feature useful (I would) since Libraries usage isn't standardized, so anyone who reads this please tell us what you think about this.\n\n- - -\n\n### What are Libraries?\nLibraries are a not so well-known native Windows function that allow you to inspect several related folders at once and from the same panel. **They're not folders themselves, but folder path groupings meant to unify different folders in different paths that serve the same purpose from a single view.**\n\nThey're not even shown in the Windows Explorer by default; you have to go to settings and turn on an option to see and be able to use them. But they're really useful for organization purposes once you get the hang on them.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31023721-7d47-40a4-9080-19b91c0b2f78)\n*With this setting turned on in the Windows Explorer, you can see both your default `Pictures` folder and your OneDrive Images all from the same place: the `Pictures` library; and you can add more folders to that library so they'll be shown in that same panel with the already mentioned folders.*\n\nOn a technical level, libraries are XML-formatted files ending with the extension `.library-ms`.\n\n### Why should they be supported in Files?\nBecause they are an excellent tool for organization and quick access to elements of the same type. Here are just a few different uses I see on them:\n- **With them, you can prevent excessive nesting; they are a tool of thematic grouping.** If you want to classify a series of files related to each other, you don't have move them all to a new folder and break the folder structure you already had in order to have a quick access to them. Instead, you can leave them in the same path and just add them to a new library.\n> Imagine you're studying videogame development and you make games both as a hobby and for school works. You have two root folders withing your documents: `School Projects` and `Personal Projects`. Within each one, you have a `Games` folder along with various subfolders, such as `Notes` in the first one or `Cute Cat Pics` in the second one. Are you gonna combine both `Game` folders into a new root folder in your documents? Of course not! As a library-user, you're gonna leave them well organized and in their proper path and create a library `My Games` to have quick access to them.\n- Less hardcore users who don't wanna waste their time navigating through a complex directory structure might find really appealing a series of hubs for accessing files of the same type scattered along their disk in a visually intuitive way.\n- They can serve as a common access point for different folders on different drives.\n\nMaybe, in addition to covering another Windows feature so that users don't have to keep changing between file explorers, we can do justice to the usefulness of libraries and make them a little bit more popular among the users.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Add a setting —probably inside General menu— to display a new `Libraries` section in the Navigation Panel.\n- Show existing libraries inside that new `Libraries` section in the navigation panel.\n- When clicking on a library through the Navigation Panel, display a view of all the folders inside that library and make them interactable.\n- Add an option to create libraries and save them to disk.\n- Add options to rename and delete libraries, probably in a contextual menu when right-clicking a library in the Navigation Panel. Save changes to disk.\n\n### Comments\n\nLibraries are stored in ``C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Libraries``.",

There is currently no way to see long file names without clicking the item with Info Pane visible, or right clicking the item and clicking Properties for the file. I believe this issue also affects List Layout. This feature would improve Files by giving more flexibility/customization in the main view modes and allowing more information to be shown for a better overview of a directory's contents.\n![Screenshot 2024-06-07 145048](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/32722303/38fad385-8b97-4756-977b-c747fd0f2698)\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n- This proposal requires a resize bar on each vertical column separator line in Column Layout, which can be dragged to change column width in Column Layout. This would be similar, if not identical, to the how resizing works in Details Layout. \n- This proposal will accomplish resizable columns in Columns Layout\n- This could also extend to List Layout which doesn't have a resize bar to increase the width of the visible contents.\n\n\n### Files Version\n\n3.4.1.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n10.0.22631.3593\n\n### Comments\n\n_No response_",

But on files app it shows all that except for bitrate.  Instead you have to scroll down and click on 'properties', then 'details', and it will show the bitrate. For me and maybe other people, I sort and download a lot of audio files and its very helpful to be able to see the bitrate at a glance, so it would be nice to have it there next to all the other details.\n\nSidenote - on file explorer the bitrate is slightly different than what is shown on files app, I'm not sure if this is a bug or its just read differently. For example a 320kbps audio file on file explorer is shown as 312.5 kbps on files app, and a 192kbps file is shown as 187.5 on files app.  Im not sure why\n\n![image](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/62226000/86967eea-12da-461e-8cbc-69cac02d9be4)\n![image](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/62226000/2185aaec-e65c-4dfa-ab54-755430beb5c8)\n\n### Requirements\n\n- This proposal will accomplish ease of access for people who frequently check the bitrate of audio files\n\n\n### Files Version\n\n3.3.0.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n23H2\n\n### Comments\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### What feature or improvement do you think would benefit Files?\n\nCurrently, Files allows to group by month:\n\n![image](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/1366654/e1cac9e0-2ee3-47b6-9da6-6ca23d7ec7ea)\n\nWhen sorting dozens of images of different locations, usually the trips / occasions differ by day (and not by month)\n\nThus, I would like to have \"group by day\". This would really speed-up sorting.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Add \"Day\" to \"Group By > Date modified\"\n- Add \"Day\" to \"Group By > Date created\"\n\n### Files Version\n\n3.0.15.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n10.0.19045.3803\n\n### Comments\n\nAlternatively, the grouping could offer to group for \"ISO date\". May files are named YYYY-MM-DD HH.mm.ss; thus sorting by them is my \"real\" wish, but I think, adding grouping by Day is easier to implement.\n\nRefs https://github.com/files-community/Files/issues/4432 (because of image handling)\n\nRelated SX question: https://superuser.com/questions/1670777/how-to-group-files-by-date-in-file-explorer",

I propose to switch to the [Nilesoft Shell Extension](https://github.com/moudey/Shell) or at least provide users with the option to use either File Explorer's native context menu or the Nilesoft Shell Extension.\n\n### Benefits\nNilesoft Shell Extension provides several benefits compared to the current context menu\n\n- Customizable Context Menu: Users can handpick items to integrate into the context menu, create custom commands to access favorite web pages, files, folders, and launch any application directly from the context menu [github.com](https://github.com/moudey/Shell).\n\n- Easy to Extend: Nilesoft Shell Extension makes it extremely easy to extend the context menu with new functions. Users can easily embed custom commands in the context menu, such as links to custom commands, files, folders, applications, and even websites [trishtech.com](https://www.trishtech.com/2022/02/nilesoft-shell-easy-context-menu-extender-for-windows/).\n\n- User-friendly Configuration: Nilesoft Shell Extension comes with a configuration file (shell.shl) that can be easily edited to add or remove items from the context menu [trishtech.com](https://www.trishtech.com/2022/02/nilesoft-shell-easy-context-menu-extender-for-windows/). \n\nWhy Use Shell [nilesoft.org/docs](https://nilesoft.org/docs)\n> - Configuration in plain text.\n> - Quick loading.\n> - Minimal resource usage.\n> - No limitations.\n> - Embedded expressions syntax.\n> - Built-in functions and predefined variables.\n> - Multiple sources of images (embedded icons, image files, svg, glyphs, and colors).\n> - Dynamic search and filter.\n> - Support Taskbar context menu.\n> - Full management of the context menu.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [ ] Implement Nilesoft Shell Extension in Files Explorer.\n- [ ] Provide an option for users to use either File Explorer's native context menu or Nilesoft Shell Extension.\n- [ ] Allow users to customize the context menu items.\n- [ ] Allow users to create custom commands in the context menu.\n- [ ] Enable easy extension of the context menu with new functions.\n- [ ] Include a user-friendly configuration file for adding or removing items from the context menu.\n- [ ] Ensure compatibility with the current features of Files Explorer.\n\n### Files Version\n\n2.5.21.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n10.0.22621.1848\n\n### Comments\n\nFile-manage\n<img src=\"https://github.com/moudey/Shell/blob/main/screenshots/file-manage.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\" height=\"75%\">\n\nTaskbar:\n<img src=\"https://github.com/moudey/Shell/blob/main/screenshots/taskbar.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\" height=\"75%\">\n\nhttps://github.com/moudey/Shell/tree/main#screenshots",

    "title": "Feature: When dragging images from Firefox, use CF_HDROP",
    "body": "### What feature or improvement do you think would benefit Files?\n\nThis issue was originally reported in #3357, wherein dragging image files from Firefox into Files would copy a bitmap file with a random file name instead of the expected file name and format.\n\nConsider a JPEG file like https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Seychelles_parakeet_pair.jpg. If we copy the image from Firefox and then inspect the clipboard format with a tool like InsideClipboard, we can see a list of formats are supported:\n\n![image](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/6560270/50b3899d-1551-4111-9261-48d10745408f)\n\nOf these, only two of them are image formats: `CF_DIBV5` and `CF_DIB`. The bitmap file that is created today is sourced from one of these two. Firefox however exposes the true file name and format in `CF_HDROP`, where it points to a temporary file in the user's local app data folder. See the above image and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/clipboard#cf_hdrop.\n\nIf we were to drag and drop the image into Windows File Explorer, we can infer that it respects `CF_HDROP` because the resulting file is thus saved as 'Seychelles_parakeet_pair.jpg' and with a JPEG format, which is what we want.\n\n![image](https://github.com/files-community/Files/assets/6560270/92c5badb-8950-4b17-8d82-5cc0cff00905)\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n- When Files is a drop target from other programs, Files will inspect CF_HDROP to determine if it is suitable for copying/moving files, and otherwise fallback to a different clipboard format.\n\n\n### Files Version\n\n2.5.1.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n10.0.19045.2965\n\n### Comments\n\n_No response_",

Double click ISO file (nothing fast happens, no virtual drive is mounted)\n2. Right click ISO file, go to \"More options\" and try to click \"Mount\" but if that line is placed too high on the screen, it can't be highlighted nor clicked.\n3. After successfully mounting ISO, ejecting it will trigger a wrong message to remove device safely.\n4. After ejecting it, the stale empty virtual drive will linger around Files drive list on the left side.\n\n### Steps to fix\n\n- Keep it simple, same behaviour as Win Explorer\n- Default to mount ISO in a virtual drive with double clicking/Enter to open the ISO file.\n- Show the virtual drive with the ISO contents after mounting it.\n- Eject silently and remove the stale empty virtual drive from the drives list in the left sidebar.\n\n### Files Version\n\n2.4.40.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\nWin11 22H2 10.0.22621.1265 up2date\n\n### Log file\n\n![Cant select top right click option line](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40889421/221368995-7f7da9d0-ca75-4665-b409-1d7d29c58074.png)\n![wrong message for isos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40889421/221368996-715523ae-a285-4aa7-abfc-c11daff3d049.png)\n![eject iso](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40889421/221368997-1346ac10-1a5f-4385-a034-b08f301a2d12.png)\n![leftover drive after ejecting iso](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40889421/221368998-5210405f-e675-4871-96a7-3052c361f15e.png)\n[debug.log](https://github.com/files-community/Files/files/10831736/debug.log)\n[debug_fulltrust.log](https://github.com/files-community/Files/files/10831737/debug_fulltrust.log)\n\n",

If an active Files window is in the background, when I press `Win + E` there will be no visual reactions, since Files opens a new tab silently. Also, if Files is called by another program (e.g. \"open in folder\" in my browser downloads), it also doesn't automatically goes to foreground.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Set Files as default file explorer\n2. Open Files\n3. Switch to another application\n4. Press `Win + E`\n\n### Steps to fix\n\nWhen `Win + E` is pressed, make Files pop up to foreground if there's an active Files window.\n\n### Files Version\n\nVersion: 2.4.8.0 OS Version: 10.0.22623.1037\n\n### Windows Version\n\nWindows 11 22H2 22623.1037\n\n### Relevant Assets/Logs\n\nScreen record:\n\n![bandicam-2022-12-26-20-47-24-158](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62269186/209551129-1b289dc8-28e5-4675-8f3d-6edec1b5da4c.gif)\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Recent logs:</summary>\n\n```text\n2022-12-09 19:28:35.2484|INFO|OnActivated|App activated by Protocol\n2022-12-09 19:28:35.9142|INFO|UpdateDrivesAsync|Adding cloud provider \"OneDrive\" mapped to C:\\Users\\anoti\\OneDrive\n2022-12-09 19:28:37.5409|INFO|CheckForUpdates|STORE: Checking for updates...\n2022-12-09 22:12:46.8942|INFO|OnActivated|App activated by Protocol\n2022-12-09 22:12:47.1341|INFO|GetDrivesAsync|Drive added: C:\\, Fixed\n2022-12-09 22:12:47.1927|INFO|GetDrivesAsync|Drive added: D:\\, Fixed\n2022-12-09 22:12:47.2283|INFO|GetDrivesAsync|Drive added: F:\\, Fixed\n2022-12-09 22:12:47.5623|INFO|UpdateDrivesAsync|Adding cloud provider \"OneDrive\" mapped to C:\\Users\\anoti\\OneDrive\n2022-12-09 22:12:48.9463|INFO|CheckForUpdates|STORE: Checking for updates...\n2022-12-09 22:12:53.0367|INFO|IsRunningOnArm|Running on ARM: False\n2022-12-10 23:41:57.8140|INFO|OnActivated|App activated by Protocol\n2022-12-10 23:41:58.5112|INFO|UpdateDrivesAsync|Adding cloud provider \"OneDrive\" mapped to C:\\Users\\anoti\\OneDrive\n2022-12-10 23:42:01.1185|INFO|CheckForUpdates|STORE: Checking for updates...\n2022-12-10 23:42:54.6423|WARN|OnActivated|Error during InitializeAppComponentsAsync()\n\tSystem.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred.

This feature can be achieved by simply adding the CommunityToolkit extension to the ListView attributes, but the extension is a bit buggy(not until you hover on ListView, it is enabled correctly) on only `WinUI3/Win11` although it should be worked on `UWP/Win10`, `WinUI3/Win10`, and `UWP/Win11`.\n\n```xaml\n<Page xmlns:ui=\"using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI\">\n\n<ListView ui:ListViewExtensions.AlternateColor=\"{ThemeResource SubtleFillColorTertiaryBrush}\" />\n\n</Page>\n```\n\nI think the most deserved color is `{ThemeResource SubtleFillColorTertiaryBrush}`.

    "body": "### What feature or improvement do you think would benefit Files?\n\nCurrently, file size units are dynamically adjusted based on the file size. While this should be just fine (or even preferable) for most people, some (myself included) may prefer to see different units (e.g. kilobytes like in Windows Explorer, or even raw bytes). \n\nAlso, having unified file size units makes it easier to gauge the size of files in a folder at a quick glance, see the example below:\n\n![files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64221830/203852658-7a0378e5-7b13-4112-859a-956f0b972435.png)\n\n![explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64221830/203852668-c2e93468-a4ea-44b0-8012-7f08985baf68.png)\n\nSo it would be nice if Files had the option to choose the preferable units.\n\nAlso on the same note, it would be nice if Files could address the whole kilobytes/kibibytes situation, for example:\n\n- By showing proper abbreviation for the binary units (KiB instead of KB, MiB instead of MB, GiB instead of GB, etc), Dolphin style.\n- By allowing to switch to the decimal units as advised by SI (i.e. KB that equals 1000 bytes, etc), macOS style.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Will allow users to see more precise file sizes, which in many cases adds additional context to the file\n- Will give more flexibility in terms of the file size units usage\n\n\n### Files Version\n\nVersion: 2.3.12.0 OS Version: 10.0.19045.2251\n\n### Windows Version\n\nWindows 10 Pro 22H2 19045.2251\n\n### Comments\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### What's the Problem?\n\nThere should be a new way to trigger the multiselect function for folders and files. The current experience could be improved.\n\n### Solution/Idea\n\nI come up with this solution, adding multiselect trigger on the left side of the name column. By doing that, doing multiselect will be faster and reducing steps required to do multiselect.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nIf yes, possible adding the select all function at the very top of the checkboxes column after triggering the multiselect. So the multiselect and select all would be next to each other on the first column (a bit rough, could be improved).\n\nAlso since when triggering the multiselect wouldn't let you open a folder by clicking or double-clicking it (if you don't disable it manually), so after doing an action like copy or cut, it should be better to automatically disable the multiselect so the user can directly navigating to another folder (well because navigating to other directory or even other drive/partition didn't automatically disable the multiselect, maybe another request?).\n\n### Requirements\n- [x] Checkboxes should be visible at the left of the file names in the details layout and the corner of items in the grid layouts\n- [x] There should be a checkbox to the left of the name header in the details layout\n  - [x] This checkbox should select/deselect all items in the list\n- [x] Add a setting to the folders page to (eg. \"Show checkboxes next to items\")\n- [ ] The current multiselect menu option should be removed\n \n### Files Version\n\n2.1.15.0\n\n### Windows Version\n\n10.0.19042.1415\n\n### Comments\n\nImage to ilustrate\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15670237/163340278-6cbc0d85-b988-40fd-821b-b7d78ae9888d.png)\n",

Add a clarified title\n-->\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?**\nThe files app makes it less easy and clear to distinguish between network drives and local drives compared to file explorer. Currently in the stable release network drives get a different icon but does not help much regarding clear separation.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3755345/120858538-3675a780-c583-11eb-89b7-430fc5d99ab2.png)\n\n**Describe the solution**\nWindows File explorer clearly separates both types of drives with a section on \"This PC\". However it also does not do it on the pane. It would be nice for Files to have a sub category on the pane for Network drives, like it is done for Cloud drives.\n\nHere's how File Explorer separates drives in This PC:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3755345/120858670-6624af80-c583-11eb-80e3-bd75ae1ac0d3.png)\n\nNotice the separation isn't present on the side pane either here.\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAn alternative solution to providing another category would be using colors to distinguish the icons better from each other. Classic File Explorer has a green hue primarily on network share drives making it easier to distinguish.\n\n**Scope**\n<!-- Please include a list of what the feature should and shouldn't do by filling in the table below.\n'Must' implies that the feature should not ship without this capability.  \n'Should' is something we should push hard for, but is not absolutely required to ship.\n'Could' is a nice-to-have; a good stretch goal that isn't painful if we don't achieve it.\n'Won't' is a clear statement that the proposal/feature will intentionally not have that capability.\nThis list will evolve and grow as the proposal becomes more refined over time.\nA good rule of thumb is to start your proposal with no more than 7 high-level requirements.\n-->\n| Capability | Priority |\n| :---------- | :------- |\n| This proposal will allow end users to distinguish network drives from local drivers more easily | Must |\n| This proposal will allow end users to have different categories for network drives than local drives | Should |\n| This proposal will allow end users to have different coloring to help distinguish network attached drives from local drives | Could |\n\n\n**Requirements**\n- Added Network Locations widget to the home page\n- Add setting to enable/disable (off by default?)\n- Stop showing network locations in the drives widget\n\n**System Information**\n - OS Version: Windows 10 Insider Preview [10.0.21382.1 (co_release.210511-1416)]\n - App version: v1.5.0.0\n\n**Additional comment**\nN/A\n",

Only post one request per one feature request\n3. Try not to make duplicates. Do a quick search before posting\n4. Add a clarified title\n-->\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?**\nDepending of the size of the file list the preview pane is either to the right or at the bottom. \nThis is a bit uncomfortable when e.g. previewing documents (pdf or word): The preview is often to small and with two (file) panes it happens that one pane shows the preview to the right and the other at the bottom.\nAlso the details pane is not always needed and it should be possible to hide it.\n\n**Describe the solution**\nThe \"Toggle the preview pane\" Buttons should be extended to a flyout menu providing the following options:\n- Show Preview (On / Off)\n- Show Preview Details (On / Off)\n- Set Preview Position (Right / Bottom)\n\n*Example:*\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4764933/118050876-649b0980-b380-11eb-8551-935892672225.png)\n\n*Remarks:*\n- Should the preview pane options be valid only for the current tab or for all tabs?\n- Instead of a simple fly out: A split button could be useful to quickly toggle the preview pane and setting the options when expanding the menu.\n- Position and size of the pane could be applied on all tabs whereas toggling the pane could be per tab / file pane\n\n**Scope**\n<!-- Please include a list of what the feature should and shouldn't do by filling in the table below.\n'Must' implies that the feature should not ship without this capability.  \n'Should' is something we should push hard for, but is not absolutely required to ship.\n'Could' is a nice-to-have; a good stretch goal that isn't painful if we don't achieve it.\n'Won't' is a clear statement that the proposal/feature will intentionally not have that capability.\nThis list will evolve and grow as the proposal becomes more refined over time.\nA good rule of thumb is to start your proposal with no more than 7 high-level requirements.\n-->\n| Capability | Priority |\n| :---------- | :------- |\n| Add flyout menu with the options mentioned above | Must |\n| Synchronize the selected options (inclusive position and size?) in the AppSettings | Must |\n| Load preview pane options (inclusive position and size) from the AppSettings at start up | Must |\n| Remove size limitation of preview pane | Should |\n| Translations | Should |\n\n**Additional comment**\n\nI already implemented a working version of the proposal, but not all requirements are fulfilled. So in case you are interested tell me how to commit the code (branch?).\n\n",

It should be possible to add a details pane on the side similar to the built-in File Explorer. This will allow the user to view file details without going to the properties. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIn the settings, add an option to show the details pane similar to File Explorer. Once enabled, the details pane should be on the right side showing the details about the file selected. If nothing is selected, the pane should show the details about the current folder. The details pane should not disappear when nothing is selected as this will cause confusion and cause the icons in the folder to move around unnecessarily. \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAdd a shortcut key that would automatically open a flyout showing the details.

Perhaps this could be toggled via a hover timer, i.e. if user hovers >1s-2s before clicking, they should be allowed to pick from the individual directories that make up the consolidated entry. Alternatively, straight up allow each individual directory to be clickable through their own UI component but display in a compact manner like GitHub does.",
