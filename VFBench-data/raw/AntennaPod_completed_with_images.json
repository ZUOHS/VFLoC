And double tap the Subscription Tab button to reset back top level/the full list of subscriptions showing tags/groups. \n\n### Why should this be added?\n\nAs a long time AntennaPod user, I became used to the Side-panel Subscription list. This list when organized by Tags/Groups these groups stayed open thus saving the users from having to re-navigate (open panel, open tag).\n\nI think that adding the requested feature will bring that ease of multi-tasking podcast management that the side-panel navigation experienced offers to the modern Bottom Navigation experience.\n\nI have my Bottom Navigation set as followed: Home - Queue - Subscription - Episodes - More\n\nCentering the AntennaPod experience on Subscription Tab where users have several podcast subscription organized by Tags/Groups. Open a group, do some podcast management, then navigate to Queue to make some arrangement. Selecting Subscription Tab again, this resets its location back to the top level showing all subscriptions and tag/groups.  It would be best if the Subscription Tab remembers the last location it was left it at before selecting another tab like Queue or Episodes. This would make the user experience more multitasking accessible. User can navigate between Subscription, Queue, episodes to setup their podcasts listening experience. Organize The queue, go over your subscription under the subscription tab and keep up with new episodes and ongoing listens via Episodes.\n\nIf and when the user needs to once again access the full list of subscriptions tags/groups, double tab the Subscription Tab.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n| ℹ️ | **Implementation instructions**|\n|---|:---|\n| | This request has been discussed further below.

    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have used the search function for [**OPEN**](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues) issues to see if someone else has already submitted the same feature request.\n- [X] I have **also** used the search function for [**CLOSED**](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to see if the feature was already implemented and is just waiting to be released, or if the feature was rejected.\n- [X] I will describe the problem with as much detail as possible.\n- [X] This request contains only one single feature, **not** a list of multiple (related) features.\n\n### App version\n\n3.4.1f\n\n### Where did you get the app from\n\nF-Droid\n\n### Feature or improvement you want\n\nI want to easily add/download a single podcast instead of subscribing to a whole podcast series (and download this one podcast respectively add it to my listening queue or similar). Ideally, i want two ways:\n* via the GUI as usually, just without having to subscribe first\n* via an URL (yeah, I know this may technically be more advanced) \n* maybe accept such an URL as a sharing target in Android and get the podcast including episode from there \n* optionally, even opening an URL would be awesome (though yet again AFAIK with Android this is impossible, as you need to register for specific URLs)\n\n### Why should this be added?\n\nOkay, full (user) story:\n1. Let's say a friend, let Peter be his name, send me a cool link to an interesting podcast, he had listened to. it's: https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/klimaklage-2-0-warum-buerger-wieder-vors-bundesverfassungsgericht-ziehen-dlf-ff0bb7c7-100.html\n2. Now, I don't want to listen to it, I want to listen to it later. I could store it in my browser open tabs/bookmarks/history, third-party software/apps/services like Pocket or so, or… as the most obvious choice and for various reasons best may be: I want to store it in AntennaPod and listen to it (later). Reasons could be:\n  * hard to loose\n  * I already use the app\n  * cannot accidentally close tabs\n  * does not get lost in tab\n  * uses FLOSS app\n  * …\n3. Anyway, I have the website opened in my browser (Firefox for Android), so what can I do now? The question I am usually pondering about is: **How do I get that podcast episode into AntennaPod?** Ideally, I'd like to:\n  * either use the \"Open in app\" feature to open it in the app (actually, this could have skipped the browser before, if AntennaPod can display a podcast directly)\n  * or via the \"Share\" menu in the same way\n  * or… okay… maybe \"manually\"\n4. So, as I only have the manual option currently, my steps are:\n  1. Find out how the podcast is named on the website. For my example Deutschlandfunk, I need to click on \"Abbonieren\" and there I can see it. (To find this out is also a thing you need to learn/know first… and obviously depends on the website, it may be actually impossible; e.g. if someone shared you a direct link to an MP3 file).\n  In my example the name is \"Hintergrund\".\n  2. Surprisingly, it works and I can find it (steps are: Open AntennaPod -> Search icon -> type \"Hintergrund\" -> (Enter is optional?) -> Click \"Search online\") – such a generic term as this one could have been missed:\n  ![Screenshot_20240919-024250](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2dfc1e-15d4-4ee0-8d85-8e3ff5cc5171)\n  3. Now, i tap on it. Actually, I now would need to find the episode. For this, I would need to scroll until I find the correct one. Maybe looking up the date on the website (by going back to it etc.) would be helpful for that, yet again this is another step.\n  **Side-note:** A search function here could help/simplify this a lot!\n  4.  In case I find it: I can tap on it. However, the only button besides the description I see is: \"Preview\". I don't want a preview though, but want to potentially download it and listen it later etc., as already explained. This works if you want to hear it right-away, but really – if I'd wanted this, I could have just used my browser and would not have gone through this \"complicated\" process I am describing…\n\nI skipped one fact: At 3. you can take another way (**workaround**:):\n4. Instead of searching directly (which I would intuitively do, if I am not interested in the whole podcast, which occasionally happens), I maybe already know, I need to click on \"Subscribe\" first.\n5. Having done that, I get a bigger episode list, which is fine. There I can search, which is also fine.\n6. So I find my episode and I can download it.\n7. But, yet again, say I don't like the podcast in general (again many reasons could be added here: too many episodes, it's outdated and I found a very old but interesting episode, I just don't like the general content/people in there – maybe that one episode was special; or I am generally not interested in the topic, except the one that was shared to me etc.), so – naturally – I remove the podcast again.\n   This warns me, that this will also remove my episodes, so now I am stuck:\n   Either I keep being subscribed to the podcast I don't actually wanted to subscribe _or_ I can listen to the podcast. Or I'd would have to remember this and unsubscribe the podcast again after listening that one episode hmm… kinda bad. (Especially bad if you have auto-dowloading enabled for all podcasts BTW, as that would download episodes you never wanted to listen, then…)\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\nNudging people to subscribe to a podcast could be a naive explanation for this. I bet this was not your intention and it's just because of technical issues (as indicated already), but I am also not sure whether cooperate podcast players maybe follow that pattern. Anyway, we don't want it, IMHO, we can do better! As such, support for **playing/downloading a single podcast** would be awesome!\n\nSo IMHO this is a big UX issue and missed use case.\n\nTechnically / ideas for solutions:\n* Next to \"Preview\" could be a simple \"Download\" button and the issue would likely be solved already. Though I see that this view was likely not intended for listening at all…\n* Maybe a bigger UI design would be to have a view for _one_ podcast episode actually. This could be opened with a tap on it and you could download it there or do whatever.\n* If downloaded, the episode could just be shown as a single entry as if the podcast has been subscribed to. However, it obviously should not and it may actually auto-delete or so if the episode is listened to (though that may be configurable).\n* Even if that is implemented a better \"podcast preview\" screen would be needed with search functions or whatever. After all, why not actually re-use the \"normal\" podcast screen, where you can see your episodes, if you have already subscribed? Just indicate somehow you are not subscribed, e.g. by adding a big \"Subscribe\" button at the top? IMHO, this would be a quite seamless integration _and_ you would have more screen space/design for the actual podcast listing (and all features like search etc. for it).\n* the link limitation for opening an arbitrary URL could be circumvented by using/[creating](https://extensionworkshop.com/) a special (very little) [addon/extension for Firefox for Android](https://addons.mozilla.org/android/) that just converts the URL, if it finds a podcast (RSS feed or so?) into a canonical link or at least one AntennaPod has registered. This could be e.g. some URL like https://redirect.antennapod.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deutschlandfunk.de%2Fklimaklage-2-0-warum-buerger-wieder-vors-bundesverfassungsgericht-ziehen-dlf-ff0bb7c7-100.html or custom URI like `antennapod:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deutschlandfunk.de…` (if Android supports that) or whatever.\n  URL would have the advantage you could show a fallback webpage at the subdomain, so if that link should get shared to other people, you can show them a landing page for AntennaPod (nudging them to install it :wink: ) and with a friendly link to the podcast actually shared.",

One minute ago? \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install app from fdroid\n2. Go to settings\n3. Syncronisation\n4. Select nextcloud there\n5. Enter a valid, existing host name. Optionally prefix with `https:`.\n\nAs I am not the one who would enter arbitrary URLs there, I also tried it with my real nextcloud instance/server first, obviously. Now that no godder app or so is installed there, as I could not find or which I am supposed to install (https://apps.nextcloud.com/?search=Gpodder or nextcloud podcasts?) respectively which are compatible. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nAnyway, well at the very least the error is wrong. It shows a dnd error, but I may expect an error like \"no podcast app y installed, please install y\". After all, that's why I chose to go this way, to maybe get a recommending what I am supposed to install.\n\nIMHO I however actually expect the login to work and the credentials/login being done (maybe via the nextcloud app sso after all) and only afterwqqrds it maybe can make me aware of a potential app missing on my server. \n\n### Current behaviour\n\nThe split view with Firefox at the bottom here proofs the site is reachable via other apps on the device. \n\nReal nextcloud:\n![Screenshot_20240613-231708_1_1](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/11966684/d1c52872-1f3b-4523-ab37-1d8fb364d2a9)\n\nAny other host:\n![Screenshot_20240613-232219_1](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/11966684/5f96388f-f89b-4ed2-9c99-431cfa58d0b4)\n\n\"no address associated with hostname\" and \"unable to resolve\" also weirdly sound like dns errors?\n\n### Logs\n\nNo logs provided. But here is a logcat reproducing the issue: \n[logcat_06-13-2024_23-35-36_antennapod.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15828958/logcat_06-13-2024_23-35-36_antennapod.txt)\n\nI.e. just pressing that button for resolving/continuing 3 times. Domain was antennapod.org for testing. \n\nInteresting maybe the 1000:\n```\nJobScheduler.JobStatus]\nExempted app com.nextcloud.client considered buggy\n```\n\nAnd whatever this is:\n```\nonStartInput event aborted\nXj.w: could not obtain extracted text\n\tat Xj.M.H(SourceFile:344)\n\tat Xj.A.d0(SourceFile:108)\n\tat Xg.A.v(SourceFile:197)\n\tat Xg.Y0.v(SourceFile:3)\n\tat com.touchtype.KeyboardService.onStartInput(SourceFile:7)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService.doStartInput(InputMethodService.java:3119)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService$InputMethodImpl.startInput(InputMethodService.java:831)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService$InputMethodImpl.dispatchStartInput(InputMethodService.java:860)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.IInputMethodWrapper.executeMessage(IInputMethodWrapper.java:197)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.HandlerCaller$MyHandler.handleMessage(HandlerCaller.java:44)\n\tat android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:107)\n\tat android.os.Looper.loopOnce(Looper.java:232)\n\tat android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:317)\n\tat android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:8501)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:552)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:878)\n```\n\nThough it's both probably unrelated and the last some Android thingy. \n\n## Environment\nAndroid version: 14\nOS version: 4.19.312-perf\nAntennaPod version: 3.4.0\nModel: FP4\nDevice: FP4\nProduct: FP4eea\n\nNextcloud 28\n\nNo crash report recorded\n\nAh and in case it's relevant the nextcloud app is also from F-Droid: Version 3.29.0\ncom.nextcloud.client\n\nEdit: also just to confirm, I now tried to load and play a podcast and it works flawlessly. So the app has no general Internet connectivity issues. 😉",

Most recently, the _Podcasting 2.0_ `podcast` namespace introduced the tag `podcast:socialInteract`[^podcast-socialInteract]. Among other things, the main function of this tag is to enable support for distributed comments for episodes through the ActivityPub protocol. This enables listeners to comment on episodes from any ActivityPub enabled instance, such as _Mastodon_ instances, meaning that podcast comments will be part of the so called Fediverse (https://fediverse.info/, https://axbom.com/fediverse/).\n\nAntennaPod could use this to show comments for podcast episodes and also allow, with different functional degrees, that users would also author comments and reply to existing comments.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n## Screenshots\n\nComments shown on podcastindex.org for one of the episodes of the Podcasting 2.0 podcast:\n![image](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/260113/64c087b8-159d-4fb7-8637-c3980ac071a1)\n\nComments shown on Podverse for one of the episodes of the Podcasting 2.0 podcast:\n![image](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/260113/53be3fd0-9d7e-427b-b4cc-cc2f0c3bce83)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe XML tag `podcasting:socialInteract` [^podcast-socialInteract] can be used under the RSS `<item>` tag as in the example:\n```xml\n<podcast:socialInteract \n        uri=\"https://podcastindex.social/web/@dave/108013847520053258\" \n        protocol=\"activitypub\"\n/>\n```\n\nAlthough there are other protocols that can be used, `activitypub` indicates that the URL indicated on the `uri` parameter points to an ActivityPub _Activity_, usually a _Note_. This _Activity_ is considered a _root comment_, and all the other comments will be either replies to this comment, or replies to replies, forming a (possibly deep) tree.\n\n**A brief word on ActivityPub**: It provides two **APIs**, a Client to Server (C2S) one and a Server to Server (S2S) one. The S2S one is predominantly more mature in the ecosystem, as it is required for interoperability between servers. The C2S is far less mature and, in certain aspects, underspecified.  The interoperability between Clients and Servers often falls back to the [Mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/). Nevertheless, a combination of ActivityPub C2S and Mastodon APIs is currently the only known way in use to generally fetch comments for a cross-app comments. \n\n### Fetching the comments\n\nTo fetch comments, one can fetch the _Activity_ url of the _root post_, with the header `Accept: application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"`. Here is an example of a response body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\",\n    {\n      \"ostatus\": \"http://ostatus.org#\",\n      \"atomUri\": \"ostatus:atomUri\",\n      \"inReplyToAtomUri\": \"ostatus:inReplyToAtomUri\",\n      \"conversation\": \"ostatus:conversation\",\n      \"sensitive\": \"as:sensitive\",\n      \"toot\": \"http://joinmastodon.org/ns#\",\n      \"votersCount\": \"toot:votersCount\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876\",\n  \"type\": \"Note\",\n  \"summary\": null,\n  \"inReplyTo\": null,\n  \"published\": \"2023-06-30T17:38:30Z\",\n  \"url\": \"https://podcastindex.social/@dave/110634382833124876\",\n  \"attributedTo\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave\",\n  \"to\": [\n    \"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public\"\n  ],\n  \"cc\": [\n    \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/followers\"\n  ],\n  \"sensitive\": false,\n  \"atomUri\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876\",\n  \"inReplyToAtomUri\": null,\n  \"conversation\": \"tag:podcastindex.social,2023-06-30:objectId=7365466:objectType=Conversation\",\n  \"content\": \"<omitted>\",\n  \"contentMap\": {\n    \"en\": \"<omitted>\"\n  },\n  \"attachment\": [],\n  \"tag\": [],\n  \"replies\": {\n    \"id\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies\",\n    \"type\": \"Collection\",\n    \"first\": {\n      \"type\": \"CollectionPage\",\n      \"next\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies?only_other_accounts=true&page=true\",\n      \"partOf\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies\",\n      \"items\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFetching the `replies` recursively, it is possible to build the full tree of comments.\nThe comments are public and do not require authentication.\n\n**Known quirks:**\n- _Pleroma_ does not return replies with the AP C2S API, but it does with the Mastodon API[^pleroma-empty-replies-issue-3061]\n- Older versions of _Mastodon_ will \"loop\" around the responses, so it is necessary to have a stop criteria when it starts a new loop (back again to the first item)[^mastodon-replies-issue-12442]\n\n### References\n\n- example feed - https://feeds.podcastindex.org/pc20.xml\n- `podcasting:socialInteract` tag specification - https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#social-interact\n- ActivityPub W3C Recommendation - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\n- Activity Vocabulary W3C Recommendation - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/\n- https://activitypub.rocks/\n    - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/\n        - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/\n- https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/discussions/623 \n- https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/304 - research notes for the eventual implementation of this feature in podStation\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/threadcap - a Javascript package that implements the logic for fetching comments, including several needed workarounds due to the current limitations to Client to Server (C2S) implementations of ActivityPub\n\n<!-- footnotes -->\n[^rss20-comments]: Embeddable comments defined in RSS 2.0: https://www.rssboard.org/rss-weblog-comments-use-case\n[^podcast-socialInteract]: `podcasting:socialInteract` tag specification - https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#social-interact\n[^mastodon-replies-issue-12442]: Mastodon issue https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/17442 (list item 4 describes the infinite loop)\n[^pleroma-empty-replies-issue-3061]: Pleroma issue about empty replies on ActivityPub C2S API Chttps://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/-/issues/3061",

Suggested text:\n\n**Error: cannot play media file**\nThe media file of the episode _[ep. title]_ could not be played. This may have several causes. Please try the following:\n* The downloaded file may be broken. Please delete and re-download the episode.\n* Something may be interfering when streaming. Please check your connection, and make sure no 'captive portal' is blocking access.\n* The media file provided by the podcast is broken. Please 'share' the 'Media address' to your browser to see if it can be played there. If not, please contact the podcaster(s).\n\n---\n\nNote: I didn't include the case of the SD card as the text is long enough already, and some of the cases would already be fixed with the delete & redownload.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![20230202_080518](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11229646/216255188-6349e870-a99a-471f-8ca2-58baf387659b.jpg)\n",

In this way, you can decide whether to re-open these dialogs after the phone rotation and UI recreation. This may improve the user experience, do you think so?\n\nIn addition, I have tried the version 2.7.1.   This will not happen during phone rotation, but it may still happens when AntennaPod is in background and the phone has low memory. However, this can still be avoided by the approach that I say above.\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nwhen I rotate the phone, the dialog disappear.\n\nNo1 before rotation:\n![NO5-BEFORE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111506060/215241733-70a0e74f-f856-45c9-8a98-40bf80c5f2b1.png)\nNo1 after rotation:\n![NO5-AFTER](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111506060/215241739-83dbac51-b02f-4418-913d-2c3f67f98602.png)\n\nNo2 before rotation:\n![NO8-BEFORE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111506060/215241757-b647559d-d685-485f-8808-b1c4e113bdaf.png)\nNo2 after rotation:\n![NO8-AFTER](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111506060/215241762-f81c4250-d7d8-45c5-b760-ca9e6c10fb84.png)\n\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_",

Underneath it says \"suggestions by iTunes\". I believe it would be a good feature if we were able to choose the source of where these suggestions are pulled from. Particularly podcastindex. If suggestions accuracy is a concern, the iTunes suggestions are not even close to anything I would ever listen to. But I'm hoping podcastindex wouldn't suggest NBC and dateline podcasts.... \n\n### Suggested solution\n\nPut a drop down arrow where it says \"suggestions by iTunes\" and allow the selection of other podcast repos/sources. \n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n![Screenshot_20220731-090505_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32688058/182027866-05a0c1ab-d251-48c7-ae30-08818985c3ee.png)\n",

I don't think we need to ask for location, unless we need the user's country, which I think it's from the device setting.  (It's possible there are older versions that used to ask for permissions.  When I look at the Play Store mobile, and the app installed, it doesn't list as needing location permission)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Go to [Google Play Store for AP\n](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod)\n2. Scroll down to Permission, click on Detail\n3. You see the app needs location\n\n**Expected behaviour**:\nWe should remove the need for location permission\n\n**Current behaviour**:\nThe app needs location permission according to Google Play\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-16 at 5 26 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/149837/104828606-1b96d680-5820-11eb-9543-fe182387ae75.png)\n",

I understand this is bound to happen if they republished and changed the UID in the feed. I didn't manage yet to pinpoint the reason why this has happened.\n\nRegardless, I'd like to manually delete the duplicate entries in the hope that they won't reappear at the next update. But when I use multiple selection to select some duplicates and i press \"delete episode\", a toast notification tells me \"_x episodes deleted_\" except **they are not**. They still persist in the list.\n\nTo exclude this might be an issue related to the podcasts that got duplicate entries, i tried to delete items from other podcasts. Same results: deleting entries does not appear to work.\n\nI also tried to backup AntennaPod database, uninstall, re-install and import the database again. It didn't work.\n\nI should point out that I'm not aware of any other way to delete episodes from episode list other than the method described above.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Use multiple selection and select some episodes\n2. use the action \"delete episode\" action\n3. Navigate the list and verify is the selected episodes are deleted\n\n**Expected behaviour**:\n\nItem selected through multiple selections should disappear from the episodes' list when \"delete episode\" bulk action is performed.\n\n**Current behaviour**:\n\n![ScreenRec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1313032/99300332-bee16480-284c-11eb-93d0-8e64a140556d.gif)\n\n**First occurred**: Not sure because I rarely ever used this feature.\n",

    "body": "The \"Add podcast\" screen is one of the first interactions users have with AntennaPod but the screen looks really old-fashioned. I drew a mockup of a rework. The search function is unified to one single search bar. The term is looked up on all 3 providers and merged together (with a nice algorithm we need to come up with). The discover section is powered by iTunes and gpodder charts which we already have in the app. For comparison, I added the old screen next to it. Click on the screenshots to view a bigger image.\n\n<img height=\"350\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5811634/57575232-01033c00-7447-11e9-87ed-73bba617474a.png\" /> <img height=\"350\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5811634/57575254-49225e80-7447-11e9-9eca-b9d09e8afd20.png\" />\n\nFeedback and help with implementing would be greatly appreciated. I believe that this screen can be redesigned without breaking existing user's muscle memory because the screen is not used that often. Therefore, I think we can implement this without the risk of getting flooded with complaints. Still, the screen is the first impression users have, so it should be well designed.",

The screenshot was taken some time ago, but right now I'm using v 1.2.1, Build 58 from F-droid and seeing it on episodes from Freakonomics Radio, TED Radio Hour and Note to self (previously New Tech City). I do not see it on the one episode of Planet Money that I have downloaded right now, even though the episode I had when I took the screenshot was affected. I don't know why there's a difference.\n",

    "title": "Streaming to dlna/upnp devices (proof of concept available)",
    "body": "I would welcome a feature to stream podcasts to dlna/upnp media renderers (cf. #280). I have implemented a proof of concept for such afeature using the cling library. (Personally, I don't consume any video podcasts and I didn't not care about them in my current implementation.) It took me a while from the first attempt, so my implementation is based on a somewhat outdated version of AntennaPod. I encourage you to have a look at it: https://github.com/volhol/AntennaPod/tree/streammedia\n\nOn the MediaplayerActivity you can find a new Item in the menu called select media renderer. \n\n![menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340733/92a87240-1ac0-11e5-9dad-64fe018aba4a.PNG)\n\nThe app tries to find all suitable medai renderers in your local network. Just select one. The app then attemps to play the current media item form the current position on the chosen media renderer.\n\n![select media renderer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340740/9c055b14-1ac0-11e5-96f0-ee32210acc74.PNG)\n\nIn fact, the app does currently not stream the content to the device itself. Instead it transmits the original URL to the device and asks it to stream the content from there. It may take a while before you can start playback. During this time, you see that the play/pause button changes appearance. Sometimes you may have to press the play button two to three time before the playback starts. Once the media item is played back on the media renderer, you can change the current position as well as the volume like you would in local mode. (Altering the volume works from the MediaplayerActivity only.)  The fast torward/reqind button disapppear since there is no suitable feature for this in dlna/upnp.\n\nI have tested this feature on the four dlna/upnp media renderers I have access to. I found out that each of them behaves a bit differently. Thus, it may not work properly on your devices.\n\nI am of course open to any discussion on if and how this feature could be integrated with an AntennaPod release (standard feature, separate module as prestissimo, ...). I tried to isolate most changes in separate files. Please be aware that the cling library (http://4thline.org/projects/cling/) requires at least API 15.\n",

    "title": "Swipe episodes away",
    "body": "This suggestion is included in a couple other issues (e.g. #125) but I think it's worth having its own issue.\n\nNow that episodes are added to the waiting list and the playing queue automatically, we need an easy way to dismiss the ones that don't interest us. Swiping away is the quickest and handiest way, and the one many Google apps (e.g. Gmail) are favouring:\n\n![Swipe](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/244618/0d5d9a26-8a6b-11e2-9b03-788207dcea61.png)\n\n![Swipe2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/244621/1110244a-8a6b-11e2-9332-d8332db43f23.png)\n\nThe user would just have to flick their finger to the left or right, and the episode is dismissed. Unlistened episodes (that is, those the user never even started listening) would be deleted and forgotten, and listened ones (even partially listened ones) would be skipped and go to the History.\n\nIt could even be used at the top of the queue (that is, on the current episode) to skip the current episode and start listening to the next one, which would be an easy way to implement Skip without having to use extra buttons or UI elements.\n",

    "title": "Use a dropdown instead of tabs",
    "body": "Here's a couple mockups of AntennaPod if it used a dropdown to move between sections instead of tabs:\n\n![Dropdown](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/244538/7dcedcc8-8a68-11e2-93a1-4ab5c43ddf8d.png)\n\n![Dropdown2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/244563/55e5cf68-8a69-11e2-8c70-b5b0bbce67fe.png)\n\nI have several reasons to think that this would be better than we have now:\n- First, it would save space. Once you have subscribed to the desired podcasts (and once auto-download and auto-enqueue are implemented) the user shouldn't really have a lot of reasons to switch between sections. He will probably spend most of the time in the Episodes section, so I think that the saved space will become more important than being able to change sections quickly.\n- Second, it would allow to move the History section into the dropdown. Which, being a section and not an action, I think would make more sense than having it inside the overflow menu.\n- Third and most important, it would allow to swipe episodes away. Unwanted episodes could be dismissed very quickly, with the flick of a finger. Which will become very important once new episodes are added automatically to the waiting list. It's important to note that swiping away is impossible with the current approach because horizontal movement just changes sections.\n",

    "title": "Simplify the long-press menu",
    "body": "This issue is related to #116 because it implies the workflow suggested there.\n\nWhen you long-press an episode you get a lot of options that could be simplified:\n\n![Screenshot_2013-03-07-16-50-09](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/232777/7ef0850a-8740-11e2-9aaf-15b31a01ae58.png)\n\nIn that screenshot:\n- \"Remove\" deletes the file but leaves the episode in the playing queue.\n- \"Remove from queue\" returns the file to the waiting list, but keeps the file in the phone.\n\nIf #116 is implemented neither of the above would make sense because being in the queue imply being downloaded, and the other way around. But we do need:\n- A \"Remove\" option that completely deletes the file and makes the app forget about the episode. This should apply to items in the queue, waiting list or history. Also, in addition to a long-press action this could be triggered by swiping the episode away.\n- An \"Add to queue\" option that takes items from the waiting list or the history and adds them to the bottom of the playing queue. Also, of course, sets them to be downloaded ASAP.\n- Optionally some \"Return to waiting list\" and \"Move to history\" options for items in the queue. I don't think I would want these, though: once you move an episode to the queue you probably won't want to move it back unless you've lost your interest and don't want to listen to it anymore, in which case it would be simpler to just swipe it away and be done with it.\n- \"Mark as read\" removes the \"new\" banner.\n- \"Mark as unread\" adds it again.\n\nI find these largely irrelevant and, unless I've misunderstood their function, I don't think they're worth two slots in the long-press menu.\n\nTherefore, if you long-press an item in the playing queue I think that you should get these options:\n- Play, which moves the episode to the top and starts playing it.\n- Remove, already explained.\n\nAnd if you long-press an item in the waiting list or history you should get:\n- Play.\n- Remove.\n- Add to playing queue, which adds it to the bottom of the queue.\n\nIn addition to that, It could be useful to show these options as buttons on the bottom bar so that you can apply them to several items at once. Here's a quick mockup:\n\n![Antennapod](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/694794/233013/00638e92-8747-11e2-8fd0-dd6cf3057409.png)\n\nAs you see the mockup shows several selected items and three buttons at the bottom bar, which correspond to Play, Remove and Add to queue.\n",

Its card is a bit bigger than the rest and shows some extra data. It also has a bigger proggress bar that lets you scroll through the episode.\n\nAs specified in #116 all new episodes are added to the bottom of the \"Undownloaded\" list. As you listen to the ones at the top they get deleted, making room, and the ones at the top of \"Undownloaded\" are downloaded and moved to the bottom of the \"Downloaded\" list, so that you know that you can listen to them without using any mobile data.\n\nYou can browse through the whole list and if any particular episodes don't attract you you can simply swipe them away and make room for new ones, which is one of the main benefits of the card interface.\n\nIf you're browsing through the Undownloaded episodes and you see one that you like you can long-press it and choose to \"Play\" it (which moves it to the top of the Downloaded list and starts playing it right away) or \"Download\" it (which moves it to the bottom of the Downloaded list).\n",
