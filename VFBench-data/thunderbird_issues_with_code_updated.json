    "title": "Proper formatting when sending RTL/BiDi messages",
    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have used the search function to see if someone else has already submitted the same feature request.\n- [X] I will describe the problem with as much detail as possible.\n- [X] This issue only contains a request for one single feature, **not** multiple (related) features.\n\n### App version\n\n6.400\n\n### Problem you are trying to solve\n\nI'd like to be able to send messages containing RTL/BiDi text, which will be rendered correctly by the receiver. Currently, when I send such messages, they render correctly only in k9 itself (and that only under specific circumstances), but not, e.g., in Gmail.\n\nIt's actually a bit complicated, so bear with me...\n\nRTL languages (such as Hebrew / Arabic / Persian) are written right-to-left -- this refers both to the fact that the text is aligned to the right rather than to the left, as well as the fact that the second letter of a word is written to the left of  the first letter, and the second word is written to the left of the first word, etc. When mixing RTL and LTR text in the same paragraph, things are even more complicated. Proper rendering of such text is done by the BiDi (bidirectional) algorithm. Specifically (and simplifying a bit), part of the algorithm is that the paragraph direction is determined by the language of the first character.\n\nIn the following examples, \"אבג\" is the first logical word, with its first letter being \"א\" (Hebrew letter Aleph). The second word is \"abc\", and the third word is \"דהו\". As explained above, since the first character is in Hebrew (an RTL language) , the entire paragraph should be aligned to the right.\n\nWhen *composing* the message in k9, it renders correctly:\n![t1-compose-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206689673-3fb50c02-a2fa-4901-ba5e-e71710f4dff6.png)\nNote that the first word (אבג) is rightmost, followed (moving from right-to-left) by the second word (abc) and then the third (דהו). Also, the entire paragraph is aligned to the right.\n\nHowever, when *viewing* the received message in k9, it does not display correctly:\n![t1-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206691308-8267ae32-6978-4d24-bb0f-687384b19652.png)\nNot only is the entire text aligned to the left, but also the first word appears left-most, rather than right-most.\n\nThe received message is also rendered incorrectly when viewed in gmail:\n![t1-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206691954-737dc370-dc69-4e3e-b617-d73606a2afcd.png)\n\nOn the other hand, when trying the same test from Gmail, it displays correctly all along -- displays correctly while composing it in gmail:\n![t3-compose-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692209-9af61a72-3fb8-4f4b-a428-7a2b724619f0.png)\nrenders correctly after being received in gmail:\n![t3-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692276-a836479c-d78e-4890-a746-c6ee684d3467.png)\nand also renders correctly when viewed in k9:\n![t3-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206692360-294572a6-ccef-4305-82a6-87359d1b869b.png)\n\nNote that both messages are composed in HTML/RTF format. However, when inspecting the messages, it can be seen that the one composed by gmail conatins html \"dir\" attributes (showing only the text/html part of the message):\n```\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=\"UTF-8\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<div dir=3D\"ltr\"><div dir=3D\"rtl\"><span class=3D\"gmail_default\" style=3D\"fo=\nnt-family:tahoma,sans-serif;font-size:small\">=D7=90=D7=91=D7=92 abc =D7=93=\n=D7=94=D7=95<br></span></div></div>\n```\nwhereas the one composed by k9 does not:\n```\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>=D7=90=D7=91=D7=92 abc =D7=93=D7=94=D7=95</body>=\n</html>\n```\n\nAs I started looking into whether this issue has already been reported, I came across a bunch of issues which seemingly *were* related -- especially #3391 and the associated PR #4841 -- however, although they are marked as fixed, clearly a problem still persists.\n\nSo continuing to investigate, I noticed that the above fix is applying the \"dir\" attribute to a `<pre>` element. So I tried the same tests with plaintext-formatted messages, with the following results: while composing the message in k9, all is good:\n![t2-compose-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695560-ca27c8bc-b2c0-43d2-82cf-4a186d3740a1.png)\nAnd now, also when viewing the received message in k9, it is rendered correctly!\n![t2-view-k9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695674-efcee0a8-d44f-41b4-bb56-8d9de01a5c0e.png)\nHowever, when viewed in gmail it still renders incorrectly:\n![t2-view-gmail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830975/206695783-0da9b0f3-3f4b-485e-94f9-58911dbc536c.png)\n\nThe sent message is, truly, plaintext, so no formatting instructions can be applied to it. It is rendered correctly by k9 because the above-mentioned fix forces `<pre dir=\"auto\"...` onto the text while rendering. However, gmail (and, seemingly, most other mail clients) do not do that, and so it is rendered incorrectly by them. One can argue about which approach is more correct, but as long as most of the world is not yet using k9, it means that k9 users still have a problem communicating with non-k9 users...\n\nBTW, gmail approaches the issue differently (I'll spare the screenshots for this): when composing in plaintext mode it does not apply any bidi processing even during the composition -- and if the user tried to manually switch the text direction (the formatting UI in gmail allows that) it immediately switches to RTF format rather than plaintext.\n\n\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nThe solution, I *think*, is to surround outgoing HTML-formatted messages with a `<div dir=\"auto\"...` *as part of the sent content itself*.\n\nI realize that part of the problem here is that k9 doesn't yet provide a rich-formatting UI, so such formatting can't be applied explicitly by the user. But until such a time the above behavior would seem to be correct (and innocuous). And in fact, even once a formatting UI is provided, it probably would *still* be correct to automatically apply such a \"dir\" attribute, unless explicitly overridden by the explicit formatting.\n\nNot only would this solve the interoperability problem between k9 and non-k9 users, but, as observed, currently even within k9 itself, HTML-formatted message are rendered correctly while composing, but rendered *incorrectly* when viewed. The suggested fix would align the text as being rendered while composing with what would actually be viewed later on by k9 itself.\n\nThanks!\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Message view redesign",
    "body": "We're currently working on a new design for the message view. A (non-final) preview can be seen below.\n\n### Current state\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913295-709ad7d1-5f93-407a-a4b3-1fc2ae91f53c.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\n### Preview\n\n![Message header - HiFi - no download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913577-e27dd2f1-6b93-4a7b-a332-3cb3ada070f6.png)\n\n\nNotes on the image:\n- The chip containing \"Thunderbird Ryan\" is the name of the account the message belongs to. The chip is colored using the account color. It will only be displayed if there's more than one account.\n- The text below the chip is the subject of the message.\n- The circle-shaped image is the contact picture of the sender of the message.\n- The text at the top of the gray area, to the right of the contact picture is the name of the sender.\n- To the right we have a reply action and an overflow menu containing more actions.\n- Below the sender name there's information about the recipients. If the account only has one identity and the message was addressed to it, \"to me\" will be displayed. If the account has multiple identities the text that is shown will be \"to &lt;name of identity>\". If the message was addressed to someone else their display name will be shows. For now at most two recipient names will be displayed. If there's more recipients \"+x\" will be shown.\n- If a crypto provider is enabled for the account, an encryption indicator is displayed in front of the recipient text.\n- The \"Important, Todo, Work\" text is labels added to the message. This won't be relevant until #769 is implemented.\n- The \"show remote images\" button is not final and might move and/or change appearance.\n\nTapping any part of the gray area other than the action buttons on the right (reply, overflow menu), will open a bottom sheet containing details about the message.\n\n![Message header - Bottom Drawer HiFi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/190913663-8bb66aa2-3bbc-4b31-8479-21d770af4d73.png)\n\nIf there are a lot of recipients the bottom sheet can be dragged up to make it cover the whole screen. In that case we intend to provide a way to search/filter the recipient list.\n\n\n### Feedback\n\nWe're still working on the design. But if you're missing a feature or have other feedback, please let us know in a comment.\n\n---\n### Initial design considerations\n\nA message view redesign should include the following features:\n- #6180\n\nAnd it should keep in mind these features that we want to add further down the line:\n- #6181 \n   Email addresses need to be far enough apart so tapping them reliably is not a problem.\n- #1119 \n   We probably want to display the email address below the name and then hide the recipient addresses.\n- #769\n   Figure out where to display them.\n- #762 \n  Figure out where to display the folder name(s) (JMAP supports messages living in multiple folders).\n- #6197 \n  All of the per-message information/actions should live in the message header area, because at some point we'll want to display more than one message in this view. We need some touch area that collapses/expands the whole message.\n- #1397 \n  We need an overflow menu or some other place to put (less important) per-message actions like this.\n\nThis is what the message view looks like in other apps…\n\nGmail:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181325163-382d986e-24b6-450e-a48b-8802d9cc1c8b.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181325707-71db978e-5d33-4bd2-9deb-1b52509f2a03.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nOutlook:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181329504-6e21e461-87b6-4db2-a4dc-cdbde0c7d7a8.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181331199-cdc8b989-e39f-4a9b-af5f-9176f8bf0d3f.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nFairEmail:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181333692-a178adc5-f01c-480d-ba79-13e34e2bba21.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/218061/181334269-1cce6bc4-9079-46fe-b2d5-c210b9ea52f7.png\" alt=\"image\" width=300>\n\nEDIT 2022-09-18: Updated with latest design.",

    "title": "\"Waiting for new emails\" notification should use low priority",
    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nFirst of all, congrats on the 5.800 release! It's clear it was a long road to get here, but it looks and works great.\n\nA family member is stuck on an older version of Android (7.1) and is finding the new push \"waiting for new emails\" notification annoying. It appears with normal priority (so it's interleaved with all of their other notifications) and it doesn't appear possible to disable it without disabling _all_ notifications for K-9 (which would sort of defeat the purpose of having push enabled in the first place).\n\nWe took a look at the documentation [for silencing or disabling the notification](https://forum.k9mail.app/t/how-to-configure-push/1102/1#notification-3), but these instructions don't appear to apply to Android 7.1 or below. Specifically, there doesn't appear to be a mechanism for granularly disabling or silencing specific kinds of notifications from an app -- it's all or nothing.\n\nThe notification on Android 7.1 looks like the one covered in the FAQ post:\n\n![ss1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258318-d837de77-3de0-4512-8afa-42c7799db649.png)\n\nHowever, long-pressing the notification reveals this menu instead of one that allows you to toggle individual notification types:\n\n![ss2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258559-73eed04e-d2aa-4df4-b8ce-ab36ffbdd3f9.png)\n\nThe \"More Settings\" option doesn't offer more granular configurability either:\n\n![ss3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128258649-c56f75c3-8dc2-4105-8bca-ff51a6321314.png)\n\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nOther apps seem to solve this problem by using low-priority notifications. For example, when [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) is running in an environment without Play Services, it'll spawn a persistent notification similar to K-9's. However, the notification doesn't have an icon that appears in the status bar -- you have to pull down the notification shade to see it at all -- and it appears at the very bottom of the notification list, in a slightly dimmed colour:\n\n![ss4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567041/128259232-b5453345-f1cb-446c-9d81-668b58f33762.png)\n\nSignal _message_ notifications, of course, appear with normal priority.\n\nAbsent any way to hide specific kinds of notifications for a given app on older versions of Android, having K-9 do this seems like it would be the best and least obtrusive solution.\n\nIn case it helps, I took a quick look in Signal's code -- [this appears to be the method and parameter in question](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/1a56924a56a191a1271ba70b2e12a3af3ad289bc/app/src/main/java/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/messages/IncomingMessageObserver.java#L275), using `androidx.core.app.NotificationCompat.Builder`. The [docs for the method](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setPriority(int)) explain:\n\n> On platforms `Build.VERSION_CODES.O` and above this value is ignored in favor of the importance value set on the notification's channel. **On older platforms, this value is still used, so it is still required for apps supporting those platforms.**\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nThe family member could disable push and enable polling instead. (This is slightly annoying, since push/IDLE seemed to work fine on previous versions of K-9 without the notification, with battery optimizations disabled. My understanding is that the notification is necessary specifically for new versions of Android, which is fair enough.)\n\nOr they could roll back to an older version of K-9. This would definitely be a shame -- and probably not ideal long-term for security and maintenance -- but would fix the notification annoyance.\n",
