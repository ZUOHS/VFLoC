Currently, it always opens at the top of the list - which requires lots of scrolling if one just wants to move to the \"next list\".\n\nExample: in the following screenshot, a list with name \"white\" is opened. When user taps on this list name, the list selection dialog opens, but the list \"white\" is not visible (one needs to scroll down to see it).\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace2e77e-7718-4bcf-bc7b-c7c531722635)\n \n\nOriginal request:\n\nI use Lists a lot in c:geo and have created a lot of Lists.\nWhen being in a List of Caches, and want to navigate to another List, I click on the downward pointing arrow at the top, next to the List name.\n\nBefore the latest Release, that would have opened a drop-down-list of all Lists.\nWhich is indeed the expected behavior of clicking on such a downward pointing arrow.\nMore, that drop-down-list of all Lists opened positioned at the level of the current List.\nThat made navigation to adjacent Lists very easy.\nAlso, the width of the drop-down-list was automatically resized to the length of the lists names, if needed to the full screen width. \nPerfect !\n\nSince the latest Release, clicking on the downward pointing arrow at the top now opens a 'Pick a list' window.\nThat window always opens at the top of the list of Lists, instead of at the level of the current List.\nTo navigate to a List adjacent to the one I am in, I have to scroll down the full list.\nClumsy.\nAlso, the width of that object is not resized.\n\n\nIt seems that in the current Release, the list of List used when being in a List, has the same behavior now as the List of lists used when being in a Cache and storing it in Lists.\nIt shouldn't, as these two usecases are very different.\n\n\nI  would like to ask to go back to the previous drop-down-list of all Lists.\n\nIf this is not possible, I  would like to ask to open the 'Pick a list' window positioned at the level of the current List.",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nWhile working on support ticket 841995 I noticed a potentially confusing behavior of c:geo.\n\nWhen logging a gc.com cache, c:geo offers to send actions for trackables in inventory (one of do nothing, visited or dropped off):\n![image](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/assets/6909759/40eed246-ef6d-486c-a0d1-a9250c5d74c9)\n\nUsers often have different \"default actions\" they want to have associated with trackables in their inventory. For example, some should log a \"visited\" on every found cache, others should maybe not get logged (\"do nothing\"). To ease log creation, c:geo stores the last used action on a per-trackable-basis and pre-fills log screen with this action.\n\nc:geo stores a new \"default action\" on a trackable every time a log is sent to gc.com server (not when it is just saved locally offline). This can lead to following confusing scenario:\n\n* User creates a log, He changes the default-action-to-far \"visible\" to \"do nothing\" for an inventory tb while do so. He saves the log (not sending it)\n* User creates a new log for another cache. --> now in this log the default action is again filled with \"visible\" (because previous log was not yet send). This is potentially confusing\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nUpdate inventory-tb-default-action on log-save (not on log-send)\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\ndo nothing\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI want to put this up for discussion",

    "body": "We shouldn't show the same image twice in the gallery, if the large and small version of the  same GC image upload are used in the listing.\n\nBackground:\n---\n\n**Analysis**\n\nI used https://coord.info/GC1HEBH. This is a typical side using attachment images which are also displayed in the listing. E.g. the image \"Fischerprüfung\" is also shown in the listing:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168005616-7c42bcbe-d68c-4e6d-ad73-a28ae07290b2.png)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168005708-6635b9cc-aea5-4d19-a668-967093076786.png)\n\nIn HTML source the two URLs used are only slightly different (attachment references \"large\" version of image, embedded image does not):\n* Image embedded in listing: `<img src=\"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/18a9e1fc-9d5b-4089-91b3-ffb28699c702.jpg\" width=\"500px\" />`\n* Image as attachment:  `<a href=\"https://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/18a9e1fc-9d5b-4089-91b3-ffb28699c702.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\">Fischerprüfung</a>`\n\nIn c:geo image gallery the image is displayed two times:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/168006507-9d766572-531b-4e3d-a7e3-4e970aa3e6b7.png)\n\nAs of today, the GCConnector does not differentiate between the two, both are delivered as images to c:geo core. THe information whether the image is an attachment or from listing is not passed.\n\n**Solution possibilities**\n\nWhat we could do:\n* We could introduce a new image category LISTING_ATTACHMENT and make the connector(s) differentiate between the two\n* For spoiler view we could filter out displayed images by ignoring the \"large\" in URL comparison\n* We could in general (not only for spoiler images) filter out duplicate images in image gallery this way...\n\n_Originally posted by @eddiemuc in https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/12938#issuecomment-1124582668_",

So opening the dialog and repeatedly pressing the button will give you different results - usually getting more precise.\n\nMost users will not be aware of this fact and just open the dialog, click on \"my location\" and exit it again, resulting in an inaccurate location.\n\nTo raise awareness of the quality/reliability of this information we should display the accuracy somewhere in the dialog. This would enable users to wait until they get a lock that's \"good enough\" for them.\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nAdd the location accuracy to the \"my location\" button and update it regulary (ideally event-based if Location Provider has that ability, otherwise time-based). We can probably check the map accuracy circle for the best way of doing that.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1258173/165147488-06179e37-d0f1-40b0-b485-a433a72f278b.png)\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nI've been away from geocaching for a while, and was (happily) surprised to see a new material-design-esque UI. A couple of things stood out as a bit jarring though: mostly the glowing location indicator. \n\n![2022-03-24-010700](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159870505-a23f9949-7e0d-4d62-8c44-5cf304962b77.png) (c:geo's location icon)\n\nIt's a very skeuomorphic design and reminds me strongly of Google Maps on the iPhone 3. Not that that's bad on its own! I sometimes miss the old gem-like interfaces that used to be everywhere. But it doesn't fit very well with the rest of the app being material design.\n\n![2022-03-24-011446](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159871858-c8560aef-e0a6-42e0-ad01-eee24e133b8d.png) (location indicator on the iPhone 3)\n\nI also think the quick settings menu could possibly be moved up to the top bar (plus, it has a lot of overlapping functionality with the filter menu), and the zoom in / out buttons might look better round, but those are probably separate issues.\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nSomething flatter and less glowey would fit better. \n\nThis is what Google Maps currently uses: \n![2022-03-24-011749](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159872485-a9dad6b4-4528-4f8f-ac6d-acac46e69ed7.png)\n\nI think that knowing the precise location you're pointing is important enough when geocaching that the location indicator should still be an arrow for clarity.\n\nSomething like this might work well: \n![2022-03-24-012031](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159872822-c910ee43-5413-41fd-9f36-1504c2ef512f.png) \n![2022-03-24-012112](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159873219-5bc68de2-43c7-4f11-8153-b1d13e1f6bf9.png)\n\nOr keeping the original arrow shape: \n![2022-03-24-012423](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35242550/159873493-ef18ed7f-93ae-4d4a-9130-649fa658742c.png)\n\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nI was recently approached by a geocacher who would like to have the possibility to add own, private images to a geocache (e.g. spoiler images and such) which should be kept on the cache but of course not be made public (e.g. via log).\n\nWhen I heard this I thought about the existing c:geo feature to upload spoiler images in the already existing folder `GeocachePhotos`.  With this in mind it would be very easy to allow the user from within c:geo to add and remove own images to this structure.\n\n\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\n* Add the well-known \"add image from gallery\" / \"add image from camera\" to the top of the image list of a cache to select new images to add\n* Mark own \"spoiler images\" somehow (e.g. by adding \"Own image\" to the title) since with this feature their usage may become more common\n* Put a delete button next to the own images for deletion\n\nThe following is a crudely MS-painted screenshot on how this could look like (the upper image is supposed to be an image from the cache, the lower one an own image)\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/154841051-8b80d532-4140-4f24-97b4-9faf72306dda.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nNo implementation\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

Copy message\n2. Paste message somewhere so i can select only the GC code (depends on the messenger)\n3. In cgeo.main screen click search\n4. Long-click the search field -> paste\n5. On keyboard click the search icon\n\nIt'd be nice to have a more convenient way to load a cache whichs code is in clipboard.\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nNext to the search field/in main menu add a \"load from clipboard\" action that takes the current clipboard and, of it's more than just a geocode, extracts a geocode from it, then loads that cache. This would be similar to the existing \"from clipboard\" function in defining a waypoint.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1258173/143659340-e6feb504-5160-4f43-8f6a-2cc9d297832c.png)\n\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Information\n\nGeocode recognition should look at the enabled connectors to see what a geocode could look like to avoid false recognitions. E.g. with only gc connector enabled OC123 shouldn't be recognized as geocode.",

    "body": "### Tell us your idea!\n\nAlthough I really like the new bottom navigation look in general, I'm still somewhat unsatisfied with the look of the \"more\" page. Currently it's more or less an unsorted bunch of links (no offense intended! I do know where all those links come from...). For a basic member, it looks like this:\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/137530656-aeebe4f3-85d7-41c8-b780-437a1a9ac4c9.png)\n\nAnd a gc.com PM even has two more entries (bookmarks / pocket queries). Depending on screen length and font sizes, you'll even have to scroll...\n\nI have no ready-at-hand idea how to do this, so I'd like to start a gathering of ideas how to enhance and structure this page.\n\n### What solution would you suggest?\n\nA starting point could be to transfer two or three easily recognizable and frequently used links to icons in the toolbar, e. g.\n- Settings\n- About c:geo\n\nThis should be easy to realize and cause no harm, but will reduce the list by two entries already.\n(If we agree on implementing #11897, this would be the third icon on this toolbar.)\n\nNext I thought of some grouping of the remaining ten entries, but alas they are nearly as much diverse as possible :-) - Have not found a helpful grouping for the entries yet.\n\nAnother idea could be to change the textual entries into a two-column layout of large graphical buttons (+ text), but this would solve neither the grouping problem nor the possibility of having to scroll.\n\nAny ideas whether we can leave-out some of those entries? \nWe had some discussion about the \"scan geocode\" feature lately, but haven't decide to remove it for now. \n\"Useful apps\" could become a separate tab on the \"about c:geo\" screen (as we have other useful links regarding c:geo over there already), which would simply transfer the problem to a different, but less-crowded, place.\n\nAlso we should discuss the order in which the entries are shown. IMHO the most important entries should stay at the top (as they mostly do, currently only \"report problem\" seems to me being too important for staying at the end of the list).\n\n### Is there an alternative?\n\nhopefully plenty :-)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Improve variables creation workflow",
    "body": "rel. to #11520\n\n\n\nCurrently, it requires 5 clicks (IMHO _way_ too much) to create a new variable. I have multiple ideas how to improve this workflow:\n\n- [ ] Make keyboard popping up automatically (for all text input dialogs in cgeo)\n- [ ] Instead of allowing \"can be left empty\" for variable names, add a dedicated top-level button for it\n- [ ] Remove \"A-E\" button, as it IMHO has no benefit. No one will ever need exactly 5 variables. (Without being a gamer, I have a click speed of ~6 clicks per second, so the suggested top-level button should do the same job. Simply click it 5x, which still takes less time than opening the \"create variable\"-dialog once.)\n- [ ] Automatically focus the value field and open keyboard after a variable is created\n\n---\nJust for reference - These are the steps which are required to create a new waypoint currently:\n\n1. Press \"+\" button\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64581222/136570480-55cbadf3-0004-43a6-8f4d-7ede09b47240.png)\n\n\n\n2.

    "title": "Extend support for calculated variables in cache",
    "body": "Last days I thought about how we can add better support for calculated values into c:geo especially for mysteries and multis. We already have the waypoint calculator but it has a few drawbacks:\n* it can only calculate waypoints from variables. However I often have to calculate other things as well esp numbers to open locks, checksums and such\n* It does not allow for usage of e.g. formulas. For example I often need to calculate Buchstabenwortwerte (what's the English word for it?) or checksums and have to leave c:geo for it\n* It is somewhat deeply buried into the waypoint details which makes it difficult to use.\n\nTherefore I propose the introduction of a new cache tab \"Variables\" which allows for adding variables and put a formula on them. Here's a sketch on how this may look:\n\n![IMG_20210823_133035__01.jpg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/130441186-ff781d32-f046-48ba-88f3-f881a6663876.jpg)\n\nAdditional ideas:\n* Variables created here could be used in waypoint calculator of course\n* A scan could be implemented trying to parse formulas/variables from listing and adding them here. Might be a heuristic approach where user can decide whether a result is correct or not before it is added. (A 100% correct scan is probably impossible to implement)\n* Functions available for usage in formulas must be discussed. Whatever set is chosen it can easily be extended later.\n\nIdea is also to make the entries editable directly (no \"open\" step necessary) to ease their usage in the field.\n\nSome more details, probably not so important right now:\n* No strong typing of variables. Current idea is to support text and int as values in the variables. If something looks like an int it is interpreted as such, otherwise as text. Is float support necessary?\n* Variable names are Case-sensitive and start with a letter. Can be composed of letters and digits otherwise\n* In a formula, every letter-block is interpreted as a constant text, except if a variable of same name exists (then it is interpreted as the variable of course). Optionally text can be enclosed by \" or '\n\nWhat do you think?",

Load a saved configuration, create and adopt the sub-filter, etc, etc...\n\nI guess this would be the cleanest and feature richest solution, where most code parts AFAIK even could be reused without much effort.\n\nThere are very legit use cases for it: e.g. I want to display only traditionals OR caches which are contained in a specific list but what to hide all found ones. A filter which is currently not possible to build.\n\nWe could give users with the \"sub-filter\" filter the same possibilities as with the actionbar icon in maps viewer. Short click -> open filter screen | Long click -> stored filter selection.\n\nFeature should go to `master` \n\n_Originally posted by @fm-sys in https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues/10581#issuecomment-882854827_ ff.

    "body": "While working on new filter framework I discovered a potential problem:\n\nc:geo offers currently a lot of \"Search by\" functions in the search activity. Those were clearly originally copied from the old/legacy gc.com-search here: https://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx\n\nAmong them is the search function \"Found by\" (Gefunden von):\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6909759/124426473-5fe44780-dd6a-11eb-9ed0-834c60f510fd.png)\n\nNow the problem: \n* this kind of search is not supported by the new filter framework for geocaching.com\n* It **can't** be supported by the new framework because the web proxy search interface used does not offer the possibility to search by \"Found by\" (it supports only search by \"not found by\")\n\nSince gc.com is our \"major service\" I see two possible solutions out of this\n* Remove \"Found by\" search function from c:geo. As said before this was clearly only introduced anyway because it was once available on (now legacy) gc.com search, and it is no longer available to the users via \"normal\" website\n* Leave legacy search for this specific function. However, new filter framework can NOT be used in interconnection\n\nI am strongly suggest the first solution (remove search function). What is your opinion?\n",

    "body": "## What function are you missing\nWhile our new icon buttons looks fine in general, there are still two caveats (IMHO):\n- they use more space than the old ones, although the old ones were already relatively large and easy to use (touch target)\n- the image itself (\"the inner part\") is much smaller than with the old buttons, so they are harder to recognize, and there's much unused white space around it\n\nThis leads to a third thing, very visible in our cache popup:\nThe \"more details\" button does not have a fixed height identical to the icon buttons any longer, which makes this button way smaller, which leads to a strange look of both types are close by. The old look, having same height, was a very straight-forward, clean look, visually stable. But giving the \"more details\" button the same height as our new icon buttons makes it clumsy and way too big.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/124348914-f7239080-dbec-11eb-9788-92c31f66bc1f.png)\n(to the left: new style and two \"old\" buttons for comparison / to the right: old style)\n\n## Suggested solution\n- decrease the icon button size to the same dimensions as the old icon buttons had\n- increase the size of the \"inner image\" to mostly fill the (decreased) dimensions\n- adjust \"more details\" (and any other default button) to have (at least) the same height as the icon buttons\n\n## Alternatives/workarounds\n- make \"more details\" button full width\n- find a different placement for the \"hint\" icon button, maybe by placing \"refresh\" and \"delete\" on the same line, and placing \"edit list\" and \"hint\" on the second\n\nBut that would solve only the third issue.",

Does it have the same width/height already?\n- What could we show instead of the title? Nothing or something like \"Cache info\" (if it fits in all languages)?\n- It also looks strange, that the height of \"More Details\" (outline) is more narrow than the outline of the icon next to it.\n\nOther thought:\nWould a bottom sheet maybe suitable to replace it completely?\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/949669/123547222-37ec5700-d760-11eb-8280-58af09e0e4f2.png)\n\nAfter clicking on a cache it could show its name only (one liner as in the example above) and the user can expand it to view the other details...

If there is no cell phone reception, showing the details might not even work! Rotating the screen is a workaround, but very annoying and the name might be still too long.\nIMHO smartphone displays should be large enough nowadays to show the full name.\nMaybe make it multi line text and/or adjust the text size.\n\nExample ([GC97DZB](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC97DZB)):\nThe full cache name/number `Traumrunde Prichsenstadt #04` is only visible after rotating the device.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16803864/119869021-10675c00-bf20-11eb-9d06-7163a0a644a8.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16803864/119870648-e2831700-bf21-11eb-81c6-c670f05c8e4e.jpg\" height=\"300\">",

    "title": "Installation wizard",
    "body": "While browsing through the Play Store review notifications I've stumbled upon a wide spread between recurring users (beta reviews) and other users (regular reviews). While most beta reviews are four or five star reviews, other reviews have a high occurence of one star reviews, frequently with remarks like\n- no caches shown\n- no search does work\n- app does not work\n- Did not let me see ANY geocaches only let me see the map\n- ...\n\nIMHO there is a problem with onboarding our new users, the learning curve for c:geo is too steep.\n\nA couple of days ago, while working on a different issue, I had to install a new app \"Lockito\" for automatically looping over a self-created track. I had no idea how this app worked, but after installation a short wizard took me through the most relevant settings, and so I had this app up and running in no time.\n\nThat's when my old idea of a tiny installation wizard for c:geo resurfaced. Today I started working on it, and have come up with the following so far:\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156498-65544a00-47a9-11eb-9618-134388b362fd.png)|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156501-6ab19480-47a9-11eb-9e38-99e84dd40000.png)|\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156504-6eddb200-47a9-11eb-9f3e-b61393443bd1.png)|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156508-7309cf80-47a9-11eb-9d20-17730ac60e5c.png)|\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156512-7735ed00-47a9-11eb-94a2-ac0cd9633d29.png)|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156515-7c933780-47a9-11eb-99d6-131706367871.png)|\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156517-8157eb80-47a9-11eb-9a70-b655f6bd4243.png)|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156519-85840900-47a9-11eb-8130-bef2ab590a9b.png)|\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156521-8a48bd00-47a9-11eb-9796-7684192242cf.png)||\n\nAs a \"bonus\" you can select \"advanced\" on the last screen for an easy access to some more advanced settings:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/103156524-8fa60780-47a9-11eb-97db-c1cc2cb6dd60.png)\n\nThis, BTW, also makes our BRouter integration a bit more prominent, as has been mentioned (wished for) earlier in some other issue.",

Doing so, I frequently stumbled upon the problem, that most formulas in listings use upper case letters, whereas the waypoint calculator expects lower case letters.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd a button to replace upper-case letters in the left part of the calculator (`*`) by their lower-case equivalents. This would be a one-time operation, so on each press of this button the variables in (`*`) would be lower-cased, but you would still be able to enter upper-case letters after that without them being lower-cased automatically.\n\n(`*`) meaning the marked box in this screenshot:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/96377770-0ca07980-1188-11eb-8531-ec4f52584d64.png)\n\nThe button could be named \"lower-case formula contents\" or simply \"lower-case\" and being placed within the red box, but below the formulas.",

    "title": "make onboarding with offline maps easier for new users of c:geo",
    "body": "One of the steepest hurdles for new users of c:geo is installing an offline map, IMHO. Thus probably most new users (except technically very savant) stick to Google maps and miss one of the greatest features of c:geo - offline caching.\n\nThere have been proposals for downloading maps in the past (eg #6072, #7529), but they are very sophisticated approaches which try to automate everything and cover a wide range of use cases. Sadly, they are also a bit more heavy to implement, not only on our side but on providers' side as well, and nobody has done it yet.\n\nI propose a more basic approach with the focus on simplifying onboarding for new users of c:geo:\n- Skip themeing, only support downloading map files for this onboarding feature. Therefore use a map source which does not need a separate theme file. (This would be the hs-esslingen mirror of download.mapsforge.org)\n- Direct the user to the relevant directory, let them download the map file using the browser, and make c:geo integrate the downloaded file...\n- ... which would include copying the file to c:geo map directory, set the map provider and current map file accordingly.\n\nImplementation wise there are three areas of work:\n- [x] Offer a link to the map download site\n- [x] Recognize downloaded map files and move them to c:geo maps dir (current map dir, if already set, or new default one)\n- [x] Set map handler and current map file accordingly\n\nI've started working on it. Current state is:\n\na) Initiate download via Settings => Map => Download basic offline maps:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78711262-fbdc9480-7916-11ea-8c0c-d571932ed6f6.png)\n\nb) Info screen:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78711297-0a2ab080-7917-11ea-93c9-fc4f9bb403d9.png)\n\nc) Detecting that a map already exists under the same file name:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/79076617-c90e1400-7cfb-11ea-8337-44032687df2a.png)\n\nd) cancellable progress dialog during transfer:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/79076626-e642e280-7cfb-11ea-8df3-d7f4233deaa7.png)\n\n\ne) confirmation dialog after successful installation:\n(recognition of file name depends on Android version and map source; may be a more generic name like \"5.map\" or \"msf:27.map\")\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3754370/78916095-41bb6900-7a8d-11ea-8539-4db4a0731a2f.png)\n\nAlternatively you can tap on a map file stored locally. This would enter the process shown above at step c).\n\nThis is work in progress. May be ready featurewise, but needs more testing with other file types (locally and online) as well as under more Android versions.",

    "body": "As mentioned in #6716 (Managing ambiguous results in WP Calc where trailing/leading zeros are involved) it can be necessary to insert additional zeros into the result of a formulation, and in some instances there is contention as to whether these should be 'leading-zeros' or 'trailing-zeros'.  It has been suggested that a method of identifying how a result has been manipulated would be desirable and a suggestion made is to colour the 'manipulated' digits differently to provide this indication:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6573522/32086853-90e4e82e-bb1f-11e7-95aa-de13c587272f.png)\n\nDeveloper notes:\n>Implementing this is not as trivial as one might at first think for a few reasons:\n>\n>The main concern is that the text to display for a valid location is actually obtained from the waypoint itself rather than from the input strings used to create it.  This is done specifically so that users can be aware of exactly what the resulting waypoint will actually represent rather than their entered value (which may result in something they did not expect).  Although we have access to both the input string and the resulting GeoPoint's string displaying a 'diff' of these two strings is not as trivial as you may think.\n>\n>However, once it is known what colours should be used for each letter actually displaying the desired results shouldn't be too hard given TextView's support the use of HTML strings.\n\nFurther notes:\n>Once implemented this \"Syntax Highlighting\" would be most useful in conveying information to users of what leads to \"Parsing Failures\" (as related to #6802: Coordinate Parser Needs Work).",
