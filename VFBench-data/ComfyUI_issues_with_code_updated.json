    "body": "### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues and checked the recent builds/commits\n\n### What would your feature do ?\n\nCurrently there is a setting called `Comfy.Window.UnloadConfirmation`:\n\n![Selection_756](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f8712c9-841f-4319-90fc-d3d8646ea9a9)\n\nThe confirm dialog opens whenever the user leaves the page, regardless of whether there are any unsaved changes or not. This feature would change the dialog such that it only opens if there are unsaved changes. \n\n### Proposed workflow\n\n1. Attempt to navigate away from the page or reload\n3. Confirm dialog appears only if there are unsaved changes.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis was mentioned in the original PR (https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/pull/690) where the dialog was implemented:\n\n> On window close, a browser level dialog will be poped up to remind user unsaved changes. The browser message cannot be customized due to security reasons enforced by browser vendors.\n> \n> The default setting value is false. Later after the workflow manager redesign, we should have the dialog popup based whether there is unsaved content. Currently the dialog just always trigger on close based on the setting value.\n\n\n┆Issue is synchronized with this [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Issue-2254-Feature-Request-Change-window-close-confirm-dialog-to-only-open-if-there-are-unsave-17c6d73d3650813baf4bee4ac2de30eb) by [Unito](https://www.unito.io)\n",

When selecting a filter, or after applying a filter, I have to first click on the input area to allow for searching again. These should be auto-focused.\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\n1. Open the node search dialog\n2. Click on the filter button\n3. Select a filter category\n4. Click filter dropdown\n5. **Search box for filter category's dropdown should be auto-focused**\n6. Pick filter\n7. Click `Add`\n8. **Search box for node search should be auto-focused**\n9.

Here I have a suggested solution for the team to consider and apply to the interface.\n1. This is the default interface, looking at the bunch of links is very confusing, to hide the link you have to go into the settings and go through many steps.\n![demo0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39de1cf0-57a8-44ec-9088-6253af96b141)\n2. here is my idea, add a button to make it more intuitive\n ![demo1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/224fb249-f1f0-454e-b89b-de534ac77642)\n3. and this is when you click hide link\n![demo2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94269d2a-43fd-4990-9b02-f2e2ad890a9f)\n4.add link display style\n![demo3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c61fd1-79d4-402e-a87a-2385c20d603f)\nHave a goodday ^^\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\n1.

For example, when creating a new node in the right-click menu, the font is set very small to display more. However, for the current new list, although it is more convenient to find nodes, the font and spacing have become larger. If there are many search results, it will take a long time to scroll the mouse. Adding this setting can facilitate everyone to adjust it according to their own preferences. ",
