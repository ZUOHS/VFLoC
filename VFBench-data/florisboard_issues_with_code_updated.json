    "body": "### Feature idea\n\n## Suggestions (`candidate-word`)\n\nThe **primary** content (emojis, e.g. Chinese characters) and **secondary** content (metadata descriptions, transliterations) are controlled by the same size property. When adjusting the size:\n\n- Word suggestions, Emoji and its name text both change size together\n- Chinese characters and their English transliteration below change size together\n\n**In previous snygg version:**\n\n- Emoji metadata text was proportionally smaller than the emoji itself\n- Similar size differentiation existed for Chinese input suggestions\n\n**Separate the size controls to allow different sizing for:**\n\n- Primary content (word suggestions/emojis, Chinese characters)\n- Secondary content (metadata descriptions, transliterations)\n\nor idk, maybe make secondary content automatically X times smaller then primary. For example, the padding/margin of the `smartbar-candidate-row` needed to be removed to prevent the secondary text from being cropped with desired primary content font-size.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Screenshots</summary>\n<h3> Left: snygg v1, Right: snygg v2 </h3><br/>\n<div style=\"display: grid;  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 2vw; width: fit-content;\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f83d273-0844-4362-8f5b-f4a6aef95a20\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76a4e2db-a086-4b04-b249-067f1928f74c\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39a54012-7586-44d9-889c-740491a10a6e\" width=\"48%\"/>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fce0da2-d1d7-4bc2-9f06-7fa944ba91af\" width=\"48%\"/>\n</div>\n</details>\n\n## Tiles\nSimilar behaviour with tiles text vs icon size.

I've been using your keyboard for several months and I have no issues so far. I like its Backup/Restore feature because it doesn't need to reconfigure everything manually when I want to reinstall or use it to my other devices from scratch.\n\nAnd I think it would be better if you add Clipboard History as well (text-based clipboard) to be a part of backup/restore checkbox in Advanced settings, like for the Pinned and Other categories if possible. By adding that, we don't need to recopy or readd text everything to clipboard and re-pin what I want in particular order.\n\nThank you very much for this keyboard development!",

This makes it easier to implement your proposals.\n• Describe your idea in a short but concise way.\n• If you have any examples, e.g. screenshots or other keyboards have the proposed feature implemented, feel free to post them after your description.\n-->\n#### I've searched through all proposals and couldn't find anything about it and it doesn't seem to be implemented.\n### This features does exist in the samsung keyboard and i switched from it to Florisboard, so this feature directly was on my wishlist. \nBasically the last thing in your clipboard pops up in the smart bar and if the last clip board item contains an url it will be a seperate item in smartbar.\n\nFor example this text in Clipboard: 'Look at this https://example.com'\nWould look like this:\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32615971/171253798-110d9681-2a14-411d-bb14-d66df23d198f.png)\nThe first entry is the text in clipboard and the second entry is the url that is inside of the copied text\n\nHaving the last clipboard entry in the smartbar would be the first proposal and the second one would be some \"smart\" url entry\n",

    "body": "#### Short description\nUsing a theme with circle shaped keys partially cuts off the key hints, which looks bad.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Open FlorisBoard settings\n2. Make sure key hints are enabled\n2.1. Tap Keyboard\n2.2. Enable hinted number row and/or hinted symbols\n3. Create a theme that uses circle-shaped keys\n3.1. Go to Design > Manage installed themes > Create theme extension\n3.2. Tap on the orange '+'\n3.3. Select an existing theme (Floris Day or Night)\n3.4. Tap on 'Create'\n3.5. Tap on the green 'Edit' under the new theme\n3.6. Under variables change 'Common Shape' to 'Circle Shape'\n3.7. Tap on 'Apply'\n4. Tap on the text field at the bottom saying 'Try out your setup'\n\nResult: Keyboard is open, key hints are partially cut off by the circle shape\n\n#### Environment information\n- FlorisBoard Version: 0.3.14\n- Install Source: F-Droid\n- Device: Google Pixel 3a\n- Android: 12L\n\n#### Screenshots\nCircle-shaped keys\n![Circle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96789053/160252259-5b318034-eff1-43d3-962e-2ddad67ff5a7.png)\nRectangle-shaped keys\n![Rectangle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96789053/160252261-e60171aa-1ae3-46d0-935a-edeceaf3de29.png)",

    "body": "Hello\n\nWill it be possible to add a custom border color for the keys? I'm trying to recreate the following Gboard theme (razerred from Rboard Theme Manager app). In the theme, the key boarders are red while the keys themselves are black. Is it possible to implement this?\n\nThank you for your time.\n![Screenshot_20210726-015647602](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42043870/126940260-4e5f5109-51b6-4f0b-86c3-04b7ae094429.jpg)\n",

I think that it would be good if the icons for backspace/enter follow the same size as the font size multiplier. I currently have my font size set at 90%, but the icons look massive and don't change. By making the icons scale with the rest of the letters would make the keyboard look more consistant and overall better. \n\nHeres the large icons here:\n![Keyboard here with the large icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46629504/113147342-96b93780-9228-11eb-8d85-e54bc54b0f1e.jpg)\n",

I didn't quiete understand what those options even meant. So here's some ideas for renaming things:\n#### Improvements:\n1. Change \"Key Switch Mode\" to something like \"Emoji-button Settings\"\n**Reason:** This actually tells users what we're changing the options for.\n2. Rename the Options to something similar to those:\n  - \"No Emoji-Button\"\n  **Reason:** Nobody knows what the so called switch is.\n  - \"Default (Emoji-Button)\"\n  **Reason:** The \"Switch\" bothers me.\nThis is the standart-option, right? The Default should probably be at the top of the list.\n  - I don't think most users understand what internal vs system mean. So if this is how it works, i suggest renaming the two language switch options to something like \"Switch Language\" and \"Switch Keyboard-App\"\n  - Rename the last option in accordance to what the previous options are called (after renaming them)",

Because \"insert space\" doesn't insert `space` when releasing the space-bar. It triggers like a regular long-press.
