And double tap the Subscription Tab button to reset back top level/the full list of subscriptions showing tags/groups. \n\n### Why should this be added?\n\nAs a long time AntennaPod user, I became used to the Side-panel Subscription list. This list when organized by Tags/Groups these groups stayed open thus saving the users from having to re-navigate (open panel, open tag).\n\nI think that adding the requested feature will bring that ease of multi-tasking podcast management that the side-panel navigation experienced offers to the modern Bottom Navigation experience.\n\nI have my Bottom Navigation set as followed: Home - Queue - Subscription - Episodes - More\n\nCentering the AntennaPod experience on Subscription Tab where users have several podcast subscription organized by Tags/Groups. Open a group, do some podcast management, then navigate to Queue to make some arrangement. Selecting Subscription Tab again, this resets its location back to the top level showing all subscriptions and tag/groups.  It would be best if the Subscription Tab remembers the last location it was left it at before selecting another tab like Queue or Episodes. This would make the user experience more multitasking accessible. User can navigate between Subscription, Queue, episodes to setup their podcasts listening experience. Organize The queue, go over your subscription under the subscription tab and keep up with new episodes and ongoing listens via Episodes.\n\nIf and when the user needs to once again access the full list of subscriptions tags/groups, double tab the Subscription Tab.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n| ℹ️ | **Implementation instructions**|\n|---|:---|\n| | This request has been discussed further below.

One minute ago? \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Freshly install app from fdroid\n2. Go to settings\n3. Syncronisation\n4. Select nextcloud there\n5. Enter a valid, existing host name. Optionally prefix with `https:`.\n\nAs I am not the one who would enter arbitrary URLs there, I also tried it with my real nextcloud instance/server first, obviously. Now that no godder app or so is installed there, as I could not find or which I am supposed to install (https://apps.nextcloud.com/?search=Gpodder or nextcloud podcasts?) respectively which are compatible. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nAnyway, well at the very least the error is wrong. It shows a dnd error, but I may expect an error like \"no podcast app y installed, please install y\". After all, that's why I chose to go this way, to maybe get a recommending what I am supposed to install.\n\nIMHO I however actually expect the login to work and the credentials/login being done (maybe via the nextcloud app sso after all) and only afterwqqrds it maybe can make me aware of a potential app missing on my server. \n\n### Current behaviour\n\nThe split view with Firefox at the bottom here proofs the site is reachable via other apps on the device. \n\nReal nextcloud:\n![Screenshot_20240613-231708_1_1](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/11966684/d1c52872-1f3b-4523-ab37-1d8fb364d2a9)\n\nAny other host:\n![Screenshot_20240613-232219_1](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/11966684/5f96388f-f89b-4ed2-9c99-431cfa58d0b4)\n\n\"no address associated with hostname\" and \"unable to resolve\" also weirdly sound like dns errors?\n\n### Logs\n\nNo logs provided. But here is a logcat reproducing the issue: \n[logcat_06-13-2024_23-35-36_antennapod.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15828958/logcat_06-13-2024_23-35-36_antennapod.txt)\n\nI.e. just pressing that button for resolving/continuing 3 times. Domain was antennapod.org for testing. \n\nInteresting maybe the 1000:\n```\nJobScheduler.JobStatus]\nExempted app com.nextcloud.client considered buggy\n```\n\nAnd whatever this is:\n```\nonStartInput event aborted\nXj.w: could not obtain extracted text\n\tat Xj.M.H(SourceFile:344)\n\tat Xj.A.d0(SourceFile:108)\n\tat Xg.A.v(SourceFile:197)\n\tat Xg.Y0.v(SourceFile:3)\n\tat com.touchtype.KeyboardService.onStartInput(SourceFile:7)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService.doStartInput(InputMethodService.java:3119)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService$InputMethodImpl.startInput(InputMethodService.java:831)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService$InputMethodImpl.dispatchStartInput(InputMethodService.java:860)\n\tat android.inputmethodservice.IInputMethodWrapper.executeMessage(IInputMethodWrapper.java:197)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.HandlerCaller$MyHandler.handleMessage(HandlerCaller.java:44)\n\tat android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:107)\n\tat android.os.Looper.loopOnce(Looper.java:232)\n\tat android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:317)\n\tat android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:8501)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:552)\n\tat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:878)\n```\n\nThough it's both probably unrelated and the last some Android thingy. \n\n## Environment\nAndroid version: 14\nOS version: 4.19.312-perf\nAntennaPod version: 3.4.0\nModel: FP4\nDevice: FP4\nProduct: FP4eea\n\nNextcloud 28\n\nNo crash report recorded\n\nAh and in case it's relevant the nextcloud app is also from F-Droid: Version 3.29.0\ncom.nextcloud.client\n\nEdit: also just to confirm, I now tried to load and play a podcast and it works flawlessly. So the app has no general Internet connectivity issues. 😉",

    "body": "### Checklist\n\n- [X] I have used the search function for [**OPEN**](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues) issues to see if someone else has already submitted the same feature request.\n- [X] I have **also** used the search function for [**CLOSED**](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to see if the feature was already implemented and is just waiting to be released, or if the feature was rejected.\n- [X] I will describe the problem with as much detail as possible.\n- [X] This request contains only one single feature, **not** a list of multiple (related) features.\n\n### App version\n\n3.3.2\n\n### Where did you get the app from\n\nGoogle Play\n\n### Problem you may be having, or feature you want\n\nI would like be able to comments on podcast episodes and also see and reply to existing comments on podcast episodes.\n\n### Suggested solution\n\nThere are some existing support for comments on RSS 2.0[^rss20-comments] and RSS extension namespaces (reference needed). Most recently, the _Podcasting 2.0_ `podcast` namespace introduced the tag `podcast:socialInteract`[^podcast-socialInteract]. Among other things, the main function of this tag is to enable support for distributed comments for episodes through the ActivityPub protocol. This enables listeners to comment on episodes from any ActivityPub enabled instance, such as _Mastodon_ instances, meaning that podcast comments will be part of the so called Fediverse (https://fediverse.info/, https://axbom.com/fediverse/).\n\nAntennaPod could use this to show comments for podcast episodes and also allow, with different functional degrees, that users would also author comments and reply to existing comments.\n\n### Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details\n\n## Screenshots\n\nComments shown on podcastindex.org for one of the episodes of the Podcasting 2.0 podcast:\n![image](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/260113/64c087b8-159d-4fb7-8637-c3980ac071a1)\n\nComments shown on Podverse for one of the episodes of the Podcasting 2.0 podcast:\n![image](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/260113/53be3fd0-9d7e-427b-b4cc-cc2f0c3bce83)\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe XML tag `podcasting:socialInteract` [^podcast-socialInteract] can be used under the RSS `<item>` tag as in the example:\n```xml\n<podcast:socialInteract \n        uri=\"https://podcastindex.social/web/@dave/108013847520053258\" \n        protocol=\"activitypub\"\n/>\n```\n\nAlthough there are other protocols that can be used, `activitypub` indicates that the URL indicated on the `uri` parameter points to an ActivityPub _Activity_, usually a _Note_. This _Activity_ is considered a _root comment_, and all the other comments will be either replies to this comment, or replies to replies, forming a (possibly deep) tree.\n\n**A brief word on ActivityPub**: It provides two **APIs**, a Client to Server (C2S) one and a Server to Server (S2S) one. The S2S one is predominantly more mature in the ecosystem, as it is required for interoperability between servers. The C2S is far less mature and, in certain aspects, underspecified.  The interoperability between Clients and Servers often falls back to the [Mastodon API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/). Nevertheless, a combination of ActivityPub C2S and Mastodon APIs is currently the only known way in use to generally fetch comments for a cross-app comments. \n\n### Fetching the comments\n\nTo fetch comments, one can fetch the _Activity_ url of the _root post_, with the header `Accept: application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"`. Here is an example of a response body:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\",\n    {\n      \"ostatus\": \"http://ostatus.org#\",\n      \"atomUri\": \"ostatus:atomUri\",\n      \"inReplyToAtomUri\": \"ostatus:inReplyToAtomUri\",\n      \"conversation\": \"ostatus:conversation\",\n      \"sensitive\": \"as:sensitive\",\n      \"toot\": \"http://joinmastodon.org/ns#\",\n      \"votersCount\": \"toot:votersCount\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"id\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876\",\n  \"type\": \"Note\",\n  \"summary\": null,\n  \"inReplyTo\": null,\n  \"published\": \"2023-06-30T17:38:30Z\",\n  \"url\": \"https://podcastindex.social/@dave/110634382833124876\",\n  \"attributedTo\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave\",\n  \"to\": [\n    \"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public\"\n  ],\n  \"cc\": [\n    \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/followers\"\n  ],\n  \"sensitive\": false,\n  \"atomUri\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876\",\n  \"inReplyToAtomUri\": null,\n  \"conversation\": \"tag:podcastindex.social,2023-06-30:objectId=7365466:objectType=Conversation\",\n  \"content\": \"<omitted>\",\n  \"contentMap\": {\n    \"en\": \"<omitted>\"\n  },\n  \"attachment\": [],\n  \"tag\": [],\n  \"replies\": {\n    \"id\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies\",\n    \"type\": \"Collection\",\n    \"first\": {\n      \"type\": \"CollectionPage\",\n      \"next\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies?only_other_accounts=true&page=true\",\n      \"partOf\": \"https://podcastindex.social/users/dave/statuses/110634382833124876/replies\",\n      \"items\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFetching the `replies` recursively, it is possible to build the full tree of comments.\nThe comments are public and do not require authentication.\n\n**Known quirks:**\n- _Pleroma_ does not return replies with the AP C2S API, but it does with the Mastodon API[^pleroma-empty-replies-issue-3061]\n- Older versions of _Mastodon_ will \"loop\" around the responses, so it is necessary to have a stop criteria when it starts a new loop (back again to the first item)[^mastodon-replies-issue-12442]\n\n### References\n\n- example feed - https://feeds.podcastindex.org/pc20.xml\n- `podcasting:socialInteract` tag specification - https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#social-interact\n- ActivityPub W3C Recommendation - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\n- Activity Vocabulary W3C Recommendation - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/\n- https://activitypub.rocks/\n    - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/\n        - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/\n- https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/discussions/623 \n- https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/304 - research notes for the eventual implementation of this feature in podStation\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/threadcap - a Javascript package that implements the logic for fetching comments, including several needed workarounds due to the current limitations to Client to Server (C2S) implementations of ActivityPub\n\n<!-- footnotes -->\n[^rss20-comments]: Embeddable comments defined in RSS 2.0: https://www.rssboard.org/rss-weblog-comments-use-case\n[^podcast-socialInteract]: `podcasting:socialInteract` tag specification - https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#social-interact\n[^mastodon-replies-issue-12442]: Mastodon issue https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/17442 (list item 4 describes the infinite loop)\n[^pleroma-empty-replies-issue-3061]: Pleroma issue about empty replies on ActivityPub C2S API Chttps://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/-/issues/3061",

    "body": "The \"Add podcast\" screen is one of the first interactions users have with AntennaPod but the screen looks really old-fashioned. I drew a mockup of a rework. The search function is unified to one single search bar. The term is looked up on all 3 providers and merged together (with a nice algorithm we need to come up with). The discover section is powered by iTunes and gpodder charts which we already have in the app. For comparison, I added the old screen next to it. Click on the screenshots to view a bigger image.\n\n<img height=\"350\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5811634/57575232-01033c00-7447-11e9-87ed-73bba617474a.png\" /> <img height=\"350\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5811634/57575254-49225e80-7447-11e9-9eca-b9d09e8afd20.png\" />\n\nFeedback and help with implementing would be greatly appreciated. I believe that this screen can be redesigned without breaking existing user's muscle memory because the screen is not used that often. Therefore, I think we can implement this without the risk of getting flooded with complaints. Still, the screen is the first impression users have, so it should be well designed.",

But the error line on the Downloads/Log view can neither be expanded nor provides enough information to actually understand what's happening.\n\nI propose a new feature -- say when pressing or long pressing on a line -- that would show a full URL (so I can copy/paste it in the browser and try it out myself) and show the full error to understand what's going on and if the podcast is even worth following.\n\nSee attached screenshot, for example:\n- \"Unsupported Feed type: Invalid type\" tells me nothing\n- The URISyntaxException does not tell me what's wrong with the URI because I cannot see it.\n\n![Log file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4567693/9243872/e3f56c6a-4195-11e5-8154-cce38b693d94.png)\n",
