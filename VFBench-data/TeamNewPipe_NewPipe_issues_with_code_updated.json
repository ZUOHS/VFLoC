The first box has been checked for you to show you how it is done. -->\n\n- [x] I checked, but didn't find any duplicates (open OR closed) of this issue in the repo. <!-- Seriously, check. O_O -->\n- [x] I have read the contribution guidelines given at https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md.\n- [x] This issue contains only one feature request. I will open one issue for every feature I want to request.\n\n\n#### Describe the feature you want\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you wish should happen.\nExample: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*\n\nOptionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.\nExample: *Z is also a good alternative. Not as good as Y, but at least...* or *I considered Z, but that didn't turn out to be a good idea because...* -->\nI'd like the clickable area of the buttons on bottom minimized video overlay (or how it's properly called) to be matching the height of the overlay.\n\n\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers and the community could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem. If they exist, link to related Issues and/or PRs for developers to keep track easier.\nExample: *I want to do X, but there is no way to do it.* -->\nThe way buttons are currently configured isn't very ergonomic in my opinion. Their clickable area is kinda too small to tap, especially for users who have curved screen corners and don't use on screen navigation bar (like myself). I often (blindly) go for the bottom corner of the screen to close a video but end up bringing it back to the main player because there's some room below the button. Perhaps it looks better for some people the way it is, or there's some functional reason for it which I'm not aware of (?), but it seems to me that my suggestion would be ok to be implemented. I've already tried it on my phone and works well (it's rather simple anyway). So I could open a PR for it.\n\n\n#### Additional context\n<!-- Add any other context, like screenshots, about the feature request here.\nExample: *Here's a photo of my cat!* -->\n![Screenshot_20210923-123035012~01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45879751/134492656-d67f52b9-efff-4406-bd19-7f0ea901d9b9.jpg)\n\n#### How will you/everyone benefit from this feature?\n<!-- Convince us! How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?\nThe better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.\nExample: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->\nI guess this would improve reachability of these buttons for other users too.\n",

    "body": "### Version\n- [`0.19.5` from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/#0.19.5)\n\n### Steps to reproduce the bug\n\n1. Open NewPipe app on an Android Desktop environment\n2. Try to resize it\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nResizing is possible\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nIt's not resizable via dragging borders or corners and the resizing button is greyed out\n\n### Screenshots/Screen recordings\n\nAs you can see the resizing button is greyed out:\n![NewPipe on Samsung DeX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/372620/88523995-16876600-cff9-11ea-9462-8084d886ba03.jpg)\n\n### Additional context\n\nI'm using [Samsung DeX](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/dex/), which gives a desktop like experience and makes use of Android windowing support.\n\n[Samsung has documentation on how to enable window resizing](https://developer.samsung.com/samsung-dex/modify-optimizing.html):\n\n```xml\n<application\n    android:resizeableActivity=\"true\">\n</application>\n```\n\nThis documentation also has more tweaks and information on how to improve the desktop experience in case you're interested.\nThey also have [an app testing guide](https://developer.samsung.com/samsung-dex/testing.html) (although some apps are fine with this guide but won't work on \"real\" DeX sometimes).\n\nApplications like Firefox, VLC or Termux can be resized without any problems.\n\n**PS:** I know that it is possible to _force_ all apps to be resizable via `Samsung Labs` > `Force Resize` but it would obviously better to make the application natively resizable to create less friction.\n**PPS:** I'm not sure whether this is relevant but [this](https://codeberg.org/gitnex/GitNex/pulls/601/files) is how GitNex fixed the issue.\n**PPPS:** There's also [this blog post](https://blog.iamsuleiman.com/prepare-apps-multi-window-in-android-n/) that looks helpful.",

PLEASE MAKE SURE it is one feature ONLY. You should open separate issues for separate feature requests, because those issues will be used to track their status.\nExample: *I think it would be nice if you add feature Y which makes X possible.*\n\nOptionally, also describe alternatives you've considered.\nExample: *Z is also a good alternative.

Please describe it\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Maybe the developers could brainstorm and come up with a better solution to your problem.

How does it change your NewPipe experience and/or your life?\nThe better this paragraph is, the more likely a developer will think about working on it.\nExample: *This feature will help us colonize the galaxy! -->\n\n<!-- Write below this -->\nPlaylist without description is like pineapple on pizza, if not worse.\nP.S.

    "body": "I have found some cases where the current theme is not applied to all elements and only the light theme is displayed.\n\n\n\n- [X] The item / folder picker in the settings has only a light theme (this dialog is called when the user wants to change the video / audio download path).\n- [X] The menu in the tool bar in the about activity has only a light theme too.\n- [x] The license dialog's content (=> the license's file) is a HTML file. Can we apply our themes to it, too? If yes I'd suggest to color the links red and maybe to not underline them.\n\n\nI also found some inconsistent styles and views:\n- [ ] While the link to the about activity exists in the main activity there is no link to it in the tool bar of the downloads activity.\n<table width=\"100%\">\n\n<tr width=\"100%\">\n<td width=\"50%\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28891075-88dc0994-77c9-11e7-845f-2a2aad786cd4.png\" /></td>\n<td width=\"50%\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28891070-84c692ca-77c9-11e7-8d67-ee371fe29ff5.png\" /></td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n- [X] While the tool bar's text color is dark in the main, downloads and settings activities, it is white in the about activity when the light theme is applied. I think white looks better. What do you think?<br>Maybe we also should change the color of the border at the bottom of the fragment's titles (ABOUT/LICENSES) to a ligth gray wich is used for the main text in the light theme.\n\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr width=\"100%\">\n<td><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28890466-7a55b502-77c7-11e7-96a0-3eef38d775a5.png\" /></td>\n<td><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17365767/28890461-76b0257c-77c7-11e7-8de6-9b12880032e5.png\" /></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n- [ ] The license dialogs have no separators which separate the dialog's header and footer from the main content as it's done in the settings (e.g. at preferred content language setting).\n\n\n",
